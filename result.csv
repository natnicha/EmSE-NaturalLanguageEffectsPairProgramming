1,27,experience,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,28,experience,I forgot.,-0.1,0.1
1,29,experience,Have you installed live share in your with code extension?,0,0
1,30,experience,or actually you can join by browser.,0,0

1,38,experience,Let’s create the first file.,0.2,0.2
1,39,experience,how to write Java?,-0.1,0.1
1,40,experience,let's see.,0,0
1,41,experience,we'll see the instructions first.,0,0
1,42,experience,"Yeah, we can press on control, shift, and P for Java trips for beginners.",0.4,0.4
1,43,experience,"So, for quick start, Java entry, create a file, and you can now put the code into a file and press F5 to run in the integrated terminal.",0.3,0.3
1,44,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,45,experience,"firstly, open the terminal and the file.",0,0
1,46,experience,Here.,0,0
1,47,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
1,48,experience,"actually, we can and uh rename the file as we want.",0.3,0.3
1,49,experience,"but, there just an instruction.",-0.3,0.3
1,50,experience,I have a run.,-0.1,0.1
1,51,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,52,experience,if we run debug.,-0.1,0.1
1,53,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,54,experience,"let's see how to debug. and, press the breakpoint, and press F5 again.",-0.1,0.1
1,55,experience,I hope we can debug it.,0,0
1,56,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,57,experience,"now, we are in this line and we can debug it line by line.",0.2,0.2
1,58,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,59,experience,it workes.,-0.1,0.1
1,60,experience,let’s start with the first task.,0,0
1,61,experience,"uh,did you access the material?",-0.1,0.1
1,62,experience,you can also open on your computer and read it.,0.7,0.7
1,63,experience,"and, we can talk to confirm our understanding together.",0.4,0.4
1,64,experience,"ah, I can write it first.",0.1,0.1
1,65,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,66,experience,the first task is the convert string to camel case from dash and underscore.,0,0
1,67,experience,I think it's just like uh eliminate underscore or dash and change the first character to be the capitalized.,-0.1,0.1
1,68,experience,"but, the problem is why this one is not capitalized.",-0.7,0.7
1,69,experience,"Camel casing, the first character should be.",0,0
1,70,experience,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,71,experience,I think so.,0,0
1,72,experience,"So let's see JAVA ,how to write Java, what's in your mind?",-0.2,0.2
1,73,experience,what flow we have to do it?,0,0
1,74,experience,"for example, first step we have to capitalize.",-0.3,0.3
1,75,experience,no. first that we have to eliminate dash and underscore.,-0.3,0.3
1,76,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
1,77,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,78,experience,let me write a brief steps.,-0.1,0.1
1,79,experience,"eliminate dash and underscore ,right?",-0.2,0.2
1,80,experience,and the second one is changing the first character.,0,0
1,81,experience,you can also guide me you if you have ideas.,0.8,0.8
1,82,experience,hello.,0.2,0.2
1,83,experience,are you still with me or do you have any other ideas?,-0.2,0.2
1,84,experience,"you mean that Java library have the method to change into Camelcase, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,85,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,86,experience,"while you are searching, I will try to create a function I wish to.",0,0
1,87,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,88,experience,what I just wrote is only replace dash to blank and underscore to blank.,-0.7,0.7
1,89,experience,and do you have any idea how to convert to camel case?,-0.1,0.1
1,90,experience,hmm.,0,0
1,91,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,92,experience,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,93,experience,you cannot write you have no permission.,-0.8,0.8
1,94,experience,"oh , you have read only.",-0.3,0.3
1,95,experience,how should I know.,-0.3,0.3
1,96,experience,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,97,experience,here read only.,-0.2,0.2
1,98,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,99,experience,This is a shared terminal.,-0.1,0.1
1,100,experience,why?,-0.5,0.5
1,101,experience,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,102,experience,convert.,0,0
1,103,experience,"oh, I have an idea like this whenever we found that or we changed next one after that underscore be the capitalized.",0,0
1,104,experience,and I think it's the same as you.,0.2,0.2
1,105,experience,would.,0.1,0.1
1,106,experience,Oh.,0.2,0.2
1,107,experience,"yeah, I want to write check the length and here check each character.",0,0
1,108,experience,after that we should convert to capitalize.,-0.5,0.5
1,109,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,110,experience,"and then, continue.",0,0
1,111,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,112,experience,"So, what we have to revise is this one because we have to focus on both dash or underscore.",-0.3,0.3
1,113,experience,And try to put some text like?,-0.2,0.2
1,114,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,115,experience,and change.,-0.2,0.2
1,116,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,117,experience,let's try.,0.2,0.2
1,118,experience,we got this.,0,0
1,119,experience,can you see my terminal?,0,0
1,120,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,121,experience,I input the steal warrior.,-0.1,0.1
1,122,experience,and this is the same as this.,-0.3,0.3
1,123,experience,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,124,experience,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,125,experience,And another one is to change this here and see what's happened.,-0.6,0.6
1,126,experience,the result is Oh here.,0,0
1,127,experience,still here.,-0.1,0.1
1,128,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,129,experience,it's the same.,-0.1,0.1
1,130,experience,we're good.,0.7,0.7
1,131,experience,"yeah, we've got it, the first task.",0.1,0.1
1,132,experience,"The next task, task two.",0,0
1,133,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,134,experience,you can try to be the driver.,0.1,0.1
1,135,experience,"now, I can help.",0.7,0.7
1,136,experience,come on.,-0.4,0.4
1,137,experience,you.,0.1,0.1
1,138,experience,here.,0,0
1,139,experience,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,140,experience,uh it's just the recommendation.,0.6,0.6
1,141,experience,It is the rule of the java.,-0.1,0.1
1,142,experience,we have to uh create the class the name class as the file name.,-0.2,0.2
1,143,experience,file name.,0,0
1,144,experience,but I'm not sure whether the quick start is not the same name as task 1.,-0.1,0.1
1,145,experience,"but, it's still OK.",0.2,0.2
1,146,experience,hmm.,0,0
1,147,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,148,experience,I just read it persistent bugger like your function.,0.1,0.1
1,149,experience,"so, the result is a number of times, right? because the first one is 1* 5, uh 3 * 9, another one is here and here until we reach the only one digit.",-0.3,0.3
1,150,experience,It takes three times.,-0.6,0.6
1,151,experience,another one takes two times.,-0.6,0.6
1,152,experience,and third one is zero time.,-0.5,0.5
1,153,experience,it’s already one digit.,-0.2,0.2
1,154,experience,what are you doing you?,-0.2,0.2
1,155,experience,are trying to create a new function ?,-0.2,0.2
1,156,experience,"uh, let's discuss the step first.",-0.2,0.2
1,157,experience,you have to.,0.1,0.1
1,158,experience,uh OK.,0.5,0.5
1,159,experience,"so, we have two functions for.",-0.1,0.1
1,160,experience,the first function is checking that number of digits and another function is splitting the character of each digit and multiply them.,-0.5,0.5
1,161,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,162,experience,that sounds good.,0.8,0.8
1,163,experience,Let me change the function name to be check number of digit.,-0.3,0.3
1,164,experience,"so, you have digit to string.",-0.1,0.1
1,165,experience,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,166,experience,you can.,0,0
1,167,experience,"so, this function is your main task that loops for your number, right?",-0.3,0.3
1,168,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,169,experience,the main task.,-0.3,0.3
1,170,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,171,experience,"so, so, I think it should be a while loop instead of for.",-0.4,0.4
1,172,experience,because we don't know when we will be finished.,-0.3,0.3
1,173,experience,it’s only checking weather if.,-0.4,0.4
1,174,experience,whether there is only one character.,-0.3,0.3
1,175,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,176,experience,it can be changed from this to this.,-0.2,0.2
1,177,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,178,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
1,179,experience,and while for the number of length and greater than one.,0,0
1,180,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,181,experience,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,182,experience,"the index equal to zero you mean ah the index of the character, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,183,experience,each character.,0.1,0.1
1,184,experience,each digit.,0,0
1,185,experience,uh let me think.,0,0
1,186,experience,uh because it is is the main function maybe integer dot parse int convert digit.,-0.2,0.2
1,187,experience,"no. actually, I think we should have a for inside.",-0.4,0.4
1,188,experience,sorry I removed your code.,-0.5,0.5
1,189,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,190,experience,maybe index equal to zero and num length and index plus plus i.,-0.1,0.1
1,191,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,192,experience,I got your point.,0.2,0.2
1,193,experience,at this time we have to loop for all of characters.,-0.5,0.5
1,194,experience,we have and convert it 1 by 1.,0,0
1,195,experience,uh-huh and then let me think.,-0.5,0.5
1,196,experience,is that Infinity loop you know? because the number is always greater than one.,-0.3,0.3
1,197,experience,so we have to.,-0.1,0.1
1,198,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,199,experience,let’s comment out like this.,0.3,0.3
1,200,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
1,201,experience,or do you want to?,0,0
1,202,experience,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,203,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,204,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,205,experience,as you want.,0.7,0.7
1,206,experience,Never mind.,0.1,0.1
1,207,experience,you've got two.,0.2,0.2
1,208,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,209,experience,we can comment out.,0.1,0.1
1,210,experience,you got two.,0,0
1,211,experience,and we uh loop for every digit and then.  because uh if you see this one 39 is 3 * 9 and do like this until it's changed should be 1 digit.,-0.3,0.3
1,212,experience,am I wrong?,-0.3,0.3
1,213,experience,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,214,experience,I try I. I think that.,0,0
1,215,experience,"from me, is the outer loop while loop is cover all of this one.",0,0
1,216,experience,but inner loop is only one it just converts character.,-0.4,0.4
1,217,experience,"and then, put two multiply each other.",-0.1,0.1
1,218,experience,"now, we have to each one of these should be.",0,0
1,219,experience,but it is integer.,-0.2,0.2
1,220,experience,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,221,experience,number integer number of digits.,0,0
1,222,experience,we can.,0,0
1,223,experience,integer dot to string is.,-0.2,0.2
1,224,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,225,experience,uh let me see.,-0.1,0.1
1,226,experience,tell me.,-0.2,0.2
1,227,experience,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,228,experience,ha ha string and address.,0,0
1,229,experience,one moment.,0.4,0.4
1,230,experience,you maybe have to cast it first.,-0.1,0.1
1,231,experience,I’m not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,232,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,233,experience,"so, the the result is string, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,234,experience,oh sorry.,-0.5,0.5
1,235,experience,oh really?,-0.3,0.3
1,236,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,237,experience,"So what you mean is is while, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,238,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,239,experience,I've got one.,0,0
1,240,experience,And another one we got eight.,0,0
1,241,experience,"oh, cool!",0.9,0.9
1,242,experience,"oh it looks like we have no need to use for row, right?",-0.5,0.5
1,243,experience,"And just use index like you wrote at the first, equal to zero.",-0.5,0.5
1,244,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,245,experience,cool! and then we have to.,0.8,0.8
1,246,experience,we have.,-0.1,0.1
1,247,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,248,experience,we have.,-0.1,0.1
1,249,experience,we have to write a for loop inside because we have to multiply each other together.,-0.3,0.3
1,250,experience,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,251,experience,"actually, we can.",0.3,0.3
1,252,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,253,experience,no. actually we have to return index.,-0.6,0.6
1,254,experience,"no, we have to return the index because the question asked the number of times.",-0.6,0.6
1,255,experience,mm-hmm yes.,0.4,0.4
1,256,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
1,257,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
1,258,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
1,259,experience,So what we have to return this is the multiplier.,-0.6,0.6
1,260,experience,"yes, multiplier.",0,0
1,261,experience,so if you say like that.,-0.5,0.5
1,262,experience,we have to change while loop to an if.,-0.4,0.4
1,263,experience,am I correct?,0,0
1,264,experience,"if. and, OK.",0,0
1,265,experience,the time is up.,-0.1,0.1
1,266,experience,I think we can.,0.3,0.3
1,267,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,268,experience,let's create a task 3.,-0.1,0.1
1,269,experience,"and let’s get started with, the with, the task description.",0.1,0.1
1,270,experience,Oh.,0.2,0.2
1,271,experience,you already got what the.,-0.1,0.1
1,272,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,273,experience,"our flow is can you walk through each array for the each of the element of the array, right?",0,0
1,274,experience,"and try to calculate both sides and finish whenever it is equal for the both sides, right?",-0.1,0.1
1,275,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,276,experience,Uh you didn't put in the function.,-0.8,0.8
1,277,experience,I’m just curious that what’s the error is this.,-0.7,0.7
1,278,experience,"And, I’m trying to help.",-0.1,0.1
1,279,experience,"And, input in to the main function.",0,0
1,280,experience,I think this one is incorrect.,-0.8,0.8
1,281,experience,"it should be changed to i, right? because if it's fixed to be one you will start only last.",-0.7,0.7
1,282,experience,No problem.,0.6,0.6
1,283,experience,That's OK.,0.3,0.3
1,284,experience,I’ve never tried to.,-0.3,0.3
1,285,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,286,experience,"so, the number of new is the index divided by 2.",0,0
1,287,experience,Is that correct?,-0.2,0.2
1,288,experience,oh OK.,0.4,0.4
1,289,experience,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,290,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,291,experience,we have to divide by ourselves.,-0.6,0.6
1,292,experience,if it's equal.,0,0
1,293,experience,The length is divided by two.,-0.1,0.1
1,294,experience,uh yes.,0.7,0.7
1,295,experience,round down I think yes yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,296,experience,Math dot round.,0,0
1,297,experience,"floor, because round may be round up.",-0.2,0.2
1,298,experience,dot floor return double.,-0.3,0.3
1,299,experience,we have to and.,-0.1,0.1
1,300,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,301,experience,you can put in front of me.,0.1,0.1
1,302,experience,"And is that OK or not? because of our array length, 12345618.",-0.1,0.1
1,303,experience,so the length is 8 / 2 is 4.,0,0
1,304,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,305,experience,that's fine.,0.4,0.4
1,306,experience,oh. that's fine or not?,0,0
1,307,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,308,experience,that's fine.,0.4,0.4
1,309,experience,because we used a greater than and start by zero. should be 023.,-0.4,0.4
1,310,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,311,experience,"cool. and the results, we have to return.",0.6,0.6
1,312,experience,we have to return the position that makes two side equal to each other.,-0.5,0.5
1,313,experience,position is OK.,0.2,0.2
1,314,experience,"some if true, we can we can return index.",-0.2,0.2
1,315,experience,"actually, I think it's OK. is OK.",0.3,0.3
1,316,experience,to reach the maximum is the number of array divide one by two.,0,0
1,317,experience,but we can stop before right I guess.,-0.1,0.1
1,318,experience,and I’m not sure that in this programming language write like this or not.,-0.5,0.5
1,319,experience,we can create something like boolean is equal to false and false.,-0.7,0.7
1,320,experience,yes. and set is equal to true.,0.5,0.5
1,321,experience,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,322,experience,exactly.,0.6,0.6
1,323,experience,"and we have to return the index, right?",-0.6,0.6
1,324,experience,the index position.,-0.1,0.1
1,325,experience,"So, we should define the index.",-0.3,0.3
1,326,experience,no. should define i before going to the loop. and we can return.,-0.4,0.4
1,327,experience,"no, sorry.",-0.8,0.8
1,328,experience,my fault.,-0.9,0.9
1,329,experience,we can also break.,0.1,0.1
1,330,experience,I think we can return here because it's already found and we can return i.,0.4,0.4
1,331,experience,"So, we have to traverse and until the mid of the array, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,332,experience,so then you're right.,-0.1,0.1
1,333,experience,should be like this.,0.8,0.8
1,334,experience,"No. in your case uh, we have to traverse until.",-0.4,0.4
1,335,experience,"no actually uh, calculate like this works only when size is the same size.",-0.6,0.6
1,336,experience,"But, what I mean is in our case uh if we have abcde  or the first we should to calculate a and b plus c plus d plus e. not.",-0.4,0.4
1,337,experience,We go to the first to another group like a plus b and calculate c plus d plus e plus is the same one.,0.4,0.4
1,338,experience,Not go further.,-0.6,0.6
1,339,experience,"But, this loop does not have behavior like this.",-0.8,0.8
1,340,experience,Do you get it?,0,0
1,341,experience,"So, we have to first maybe maybe two loops.",-0.2,0.2
1,342,experience,uh let's try.,0,0
1,343,experience,Never mind.,0.1,0.1
1,344,experience,That's OK.,0.3,0.3
1,345,experience,Then let me try.,-0.4,0.4
1,346,experience,you know this.,0,0
1,347,experience,One moment.,0.4,0.4
1,348,experience,Let me try a calculation in a couple minutes.,0.1,0.1
1,349,experience,Are you saying you have a problem? if we calculate like I mean some of the array.,-0.6,0.6
1,350,experience,It means if we go from the left side and the right side at the same pace.,-0.1,0.1
1,351,experience,Do you know what I mean?,0,0
1,352,experience,"a b c d e. but what I understand is like if we start from the left side and calculate for the left side and every time, we calculate the left side calculate all right side or no we have the same.",-0.3,0.3
1,353,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,354,experience,you we can try your solution first.,0,0
1,355,experience,ok.,0.7,0.7
1,356,experience,let’s try.,0.2,0.2
1,357,experience,here try let’s put the.,0,0
1,358,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,359,experience,I will try.,0.1,0.1
1,360,experience,oh what's happened.,-0.4,0.4
1,361,experience,huh return.,-0.6,0.6
1,362,experience,"oh, you have to return everything and here you may be.",-0.5,0.5
1,363,experience,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,364,experience,hey.,0.2,0.2
1,365,experience,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,366,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,367,experience,come on.,-0.4,0.4
1,368,experience,It said index out of range.,-0.5,0.5
1,369,experience,get index range.,-0.1,0.1
1,370,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,371,experience,let's see debug step by step.,0.1,0.1
1,372,experience,and we got index 4 for go inside.,0,0
1,373,experience,four.,0.1,0.1
1,374,experience,yes. and then they explore.,0,0
1,375,experience,oh because of we use length.,0,0
1,376,experience,oh should have because this thing is equal to 8 minus zero.,-0.2,0.2
1,377,experience,minus zero.,-0.7,0.7
1,378,experience,it's gone.,-0.7,0.7
1,379,experience,I already.,-0.1,0.1
1,380,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,381,experience,"let's see another one, here.",0,0
1,382,experience,"should be equal, should be minus one because the array starts from zero you know what I mean?",-0.7,0.7
1,383,experience,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,384,experience,what thing you have changed.,-0.3,0.3
1,385,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,386,experience,let’s change to second one.,0,0
1,387,experience,it could be.,0,0
1,388,experience,"should be zero, right?",-0.5,0.5
1,389,experience,Your length should be.,-0.1,0.1
1,390,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,391,experience,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,392,experience,you're right.,0.4,0.4
1,393,experience,wow we finished!,0.9,0.9
1,394,experience,I think it is okay.,0.4,0.4
1,395,experience,we almost finished them.,0,0
1,1,novice,Taleh hi I'm sending on the chat.,-0.2,0.2
1,2,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,3,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,4,novice,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,5,novice,How you wish.,0.4,0.4
1,6,novice,doesn't matter.,-0.1,0.1
1,7,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,8,novice,I opened it.,0,0
1,9,novice,You still have to rename it.,-0.5,0.5
1,10,novice,You also need to rename the java file.,-0.5,0.5
1,11,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,12,novice,"sure, So, you will write or you will write.",-0.2,0.2
1,13,novice,the first character should be the capital letter.,-0.1,0.1
1,14,novice,I was checking on the Google that if there has a specific method for that.,-0.2,0.2
1,15,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,16,novice,I search from google or somewhere.,0,0
1,17,novice,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,18,novice,I have found the function for that.,0.2,0.2
1,19,novice,should I copy paste there ?,-0.1,0.1
1,20,novice,I cannot.,-0.7,0.7
1,21,novice,maybe if you click on the read only.,-0.3,0.3
1,22,novice,maybe you can change it to write access.,-0.2,0.2
1,23,novice,I still cannot.,-0.7,0.7
1,24,novice,"now, we can use.",0.6,0.6
1,25,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,26,novice,"sorry, I think that is my bad.",-0.8,0.8
1,27,novice,I was watching from the zoom.,-0.1,0.1
1,28,novice,I thought that is the same screen.,-0.5,0.5
1,29,novice,mm-hmm I have to do the second part?,-0.1,0.1
1,30,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,31,novice,Let me read.,-0.2,0.2
1,32,novice,I didn't understand the task.,-0.7,0.7
1,33,novice,I mean.,-0.1,0.1
1,34,novice,I mean the task description I don't understand like what does it come from us on the second task.,-0.6,0.6
1,35,novice,Ah.,0,0
1,36,novice,"so, I understand.",0,0
1,37,novice,yeah. and.,0,0
1,38,novice,uh and.,-0.1,0.1
1,39,novice,the idea is to convert digit to string first to then check its length.,-0.1,0.1
1,40,novice,"if it's more than one, then we need to continue the process.",-0.1,0.1
1,41,novice,"so, we will check the the length of that and within the of each item of the array.",-0.1,0.1
1,42,novice,"I mean, the character of the string.",0,0
1,43,novice,"then, convert it to integer again.",-0.2,0.2
1,44,novice,"then, multiplied by it.",0,0
1,45,novice,"then, uh do it again and again until we reached the single digit.",-0.1,0.1
1,46,novice,does it a sound good?,-0.1,0.1
1,47,novice,I'm sorry Uh.,-0.7,0.7
1,48,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,49,novice,let’s write all of them here.,0.1,0.1
1,50,novice,"so, we can cut it.",0,0
1,51,novice,"and then, put it in the second method.",0,0
1,52,novice,you’re right.,0.4,0.4
1,53,novice,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,54,novice,"um then we also need int, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,55,novice,and then um.,0,0
1,56,novice,uh yes.,0.7,0.7
1,57,novice,do we have to integer function or to convert to integer ?,-0.1,0.1
1,58,novice,Oh yeah.,0.8,0.8
1,59,novice,I think we did something wrong in here.,-0.8,0.8
1,60,novice,yeah. or we didn't?,0,0
1,61,novice,can we just do a just test it here?,0,0
1,62,novice,I'm not sure if it is well no not for example.,-0.4,0.4
1,63,novice,uh no.,-0.3,0.3
1,64,novice,I just want to test this one.,0,0
1,65,novice,and how to run this ?,-0.3,0.3
1,66,novice,I just want to and  they can just like.,0.7,0.7
1,67,novice,I just.,0,0
1,68,novice,sorry.,-0.8,0.8
1,69,novice,maybe make this one.,0,0
1,70,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,71,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,72,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,73,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,74,novice,sorry.,-0.8,0.8
1,75,novice,why do you write a for within the loop within the while?,-0.5,0.5
1,76,novice,why?,-0.5,0.5
1,77,novice,I have another idea for that.,0.1,0.1
1,78,novice,"actually, without a while loop.",0.2,0.2
1,79,novice,but it's OK.,0.2,0.2
1,80,novice,no problem.,0.6,0.6
1,81,novice,"it is num, isn’t it?",-0.2,0.2
1,82,novice,can I try this one.,-0.1,0.1
1,83,novice,can you run this?,-0.1,0.1
1,84,novice,how about this one?,-0.2,0.2
1,85,novice,can you run it again?,-0.3,0.3
1,86,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,87,novice,then we need do it again.,-0.4,0.4
1,88,novice,ah that's my bad.,-0.8,0.8
1,89,novice,I understand that what is the issue again.,-0.3,0.3
1,90,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,91,novice,that should be array string and then while loop and then move.,-0.4,0.4
1,92,novice,It just oh remove this one and remove this one and then digit parse int.,-0.7,0.7
1,93,novice,ahha.,0.2,0.2
1,94,novice,"we can do maybe something like this, int while equal to one.",0,0
1,95,novice,"then, can we do something like this.",-0.2,0.2
1,96,novice,"and then after a while, then the time.",-0.4,0.4
1,97,novice,uh because we need to run this function again and then because we need to convert this multiplier into string again and then check if  it’s more than one blah blah.,-0.6,0.6
1,98,novice,than should go like this?,-0.4,0.4
1,99,novice,I mean in the example.,-0.1,0.1
1,100,novice,"so is the multiply by 27, right?",0,0
1,101,novice,and then result is convert to the to string again.,-0.1,0.1
1,102,novice,is I'm right?,0,0
1,103,novice,but if it is bigger than one time one not.,-0.4,0.4
1,104,novice,so that one goes like this.,-0.4,0.4
1,105,novice,and then Umm just give.,-0.1,0.1
1,106,novice,uh.,0,0
1,107,novice,I found something like this.,0.7,0.7
1,108,novice,does work in my locals working.,0,0
1,109,novice,"So then, no worries.",0.4,0.4
1,110,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,111,novice,boolean.,0.2,0.2
1,112,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,113,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,114,novice,that's why I'm writing in.,-0.3,0.3
1,115,novice,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,116,novice,Sorry.,-0.7,0.7
1,117,novice,index is not given to us.,-0.8,0.8
1,118,novice,index is not given to us.,-0.8,0.8
1,119,novice,uh my logic is completely wrong.,-0.9,0.9
1,120,novice,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,121,novice,you are right.,0.4,0.4
1,122,novice,and if it is another function then.,-0.3,0.3
1,123,novice,and then should be math dot around or something like this.,-0.1,0.1
1,124,novice,It should be floor.,-0.4,0.4
1,125,novice,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,126,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,127,novice,Is that correct?,-0.2,0.2
1,128,novice,Array dot length.,0,0
1,129,novice,It has never used.,-0.5,0.5
1,130,novice,OK uh if it return double OK Umm sorry.,-0.6,0.6
1,131,novice,double.,0,0
1,132,novice,index.,0,0
1,133,novice,you are right.,0.4,0.4
1,134,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,135,novice,almost ready.,0.4,0.4
1,136,novice,oh OK.,0.4,0.4
1,137,novice,return a position.,-0.2,0.2
1,138,novice,I think we have died from the game.,-0.6,0.6
1,139,novice,"so we don't, we don't need to calculate.",-0.4,0.4
1,140,novice,"we don't, we don't need.",-0.6,0.6
1,141,novice,we need to divide by two.,-0.4,0.4
1,142,novice,we first need to go to with the.,-0.1,0.1
1,143,novice,uh I think we can do something like this.,0,0
1,144,novice,if is equal to.,0,0
1,145,novice,and we need to break from the loop function.,-0.4,0.4
1,146,novice,what is the next one? for example what if like this 1 1 is equal.,0,0
1,147,novice,and then 3 3 is equal.,0,0
1,148,novice,but all 6 6  is also equal.,0,0
1,149,novice,"but in our case, if do not calculate the one because it will say that OK.",-0.4,0.4
1,150,novice,"it is fine, then it will break.",-0.4,0.4
1,151,novice,I have one more idea.,0.2,0.2
1,152,novice,I can run down.,-0.5,0.5
1,153,novice,you can continue there.,0.4,0.4
1,154,novice,"afterwards, check Umm.",-0.2,0.2
1,155,novice,I but what.,-0.2,0.2
1,156,novice,if but after the first iteration if you stop that station.,-0.3,0.3
1,157,novice,you know what I mean?,0,0
1,158,novice,"so, let's say that index is one and the i is one.",-0.1,0.1
1,159,novice,"and then, we get the first element and the last element, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,160,novice,"And then, some first will be one, some last will be one.",-0.1,0.1
1,161,novice,"Then, if you check if equal then break or return index to stop.",-0.6,0.6
1,162,novice,It will not go further this.,-0.7,0.7
1,163,novice,It could be.,0,0
1,164,novice,I think I have an idea again.,0.6,0.6
1,165,novice,"So, we can sum first equal to sum last.",0,0
1,166,novice,Then is equal equal to true.,0,0
1,167,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,168,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,169,novice,and then it came here the next step.,0,0
1,170,novice,else if sum fist is not equal sum last and is equal equal to true return i minus one.,-0.3,0.3
1,171,novice,"If not equal, otherwise, continue.",-0.3,0.3
1,172,novice,What about this one?,-0.3,0.3
1,173,novice,We are the same also dropdown.,0,0
1,174,novice,this array length minus one is the last item.,-0.5,0.5
1,175,novice,"So, in the first iteration, we get one from the first.",0,0
1,176,novice,And then we get one from the last.,-0.2,0.2
1,177,novice,And then we add the first one to here and the last one to here.,-0.1,0.1
1,178,novice,and then compare it.,-0.4,0.4
1,179,novice,if it is equal to the is equal to true and then in the next step.,0.1,0.1
1,180,novice,for example.,0,0
1,181,novice,"for example, it is now 2, and then it will continue at true here and add another one from the last second to here.",-0.1,0.1
1,182,novice,both of them sum first sum it again 3 is equal.,0.1,0.1
1,183,novice,"so it equal to true again, it can continues until it's exact equal.",0.1,0.1
1,184,novice,"and if it is not equal, and then the previous value of this equal.",0,0
1,185,novice,it’s also true so. that means the previous iteration was correct.,0.1,0.1
1,186,novice,and there is another step after that.,-0.3,0.3
1,187,novice,"So, then it should to return that index minus one.",-0.8,0.8
1,188,novice,"I think, maybe we can just try check them out.",0,0
1,189,novice,"yeah then if it doesn't work, then we can continue with yours.",0.1,0.1
1,190,novice,"we have the double index instead what we have trying, not it does it.",-0.3,0.3
1,191,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,192,novice,"now, can you run?",-0.2,0.2
1,193,novice,I hope it will work.,0.1,0.1
1,194,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,195,novice,now let's continue with yours.,0.3,0.3
1,196,novice,index four?,0,0
1,197,novice,Ok.,0.6,0.6
1,198,novice,why zero minus i.,-0.3,0.3
1,199,novice,where is the debugger right now.,-0.6,0.6
1,200,novice,OK just go one step forward.,0,0
1,201,novice,should be one then.,-0.4,0.4
1,202,novice,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,203,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,204,novice,yeah that's fine.,0.7,0.7
1,205,novice,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,206,novice,"just really, so it's true.",0.5,0.5
1,207,novice,"but should not be true, can you run again.",-0.7,0.7
1,208,novice,ah yes.,0.7,0.7
1,209,novice,it should be enough i minus one.,-0.7,0.7
1,210,novice,now it will.,-0.1,0.1
1,211,novice,now I change it to 6.,0.1,0.1
1,212,novice,now it should return 2.,-0.6,0.6
1,213,novice,we couldn't finish the second one.,-0.6,0.6
1,1,receiver,Taleh hi I'm sending on the chat.,-0.2,0.2
1,2,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,3,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,4,receiver,oh.,0.2,0.2

1,10,receiver,right.,0.3,0.3
1,11,receiver,"actually, we can and uh rename the file as we want.",0.3,0.3
1,12,receiver,"but, there just an instruction.",-0.3,0.3
1,13,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,14,receiver,"sure, So, you will write or you will write.",-0.2,0.2
1,15,receiver,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,16,receiver,I think so.,0,0
1,17,receiver,I was checking on the Google that if there has a specific method for that.,-0.2,0.2
1,18,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,19,receiver,I search from google or somewhere.,0,0
1,20,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,21,receiver,I have found the function for that.,0.2,0.2
1,22,receiver,should I copy paste there ?,-0.1,0.1
1,23,receiver,I cannot.,-0.7,0.7
1,24,receiver,maybe if you click on the read only.,-0.3,0.3
1,25,receiver,maybe you can change it to write access.,-0.2,0.2
1,26,receiver,I still cannot.,-0.7,0.7
1,27,receiver,"now, we can use.",0.6,0.6
1,28,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,29,receiver,"sorry, I think that is my bad.",-0.8,0.8
1,30,receiver,I was watching from the zoom.,-0.1,0.1
1,31,receiver,I thought that is the same screen.,-0.5,0.5
1,32,receiver,mm-hmm Yeah.,0.6,0.6
1,33,receiver,uh it's just the recommendation.,0.6,0.6
1,34,receiver,It is the rule of the java.,-0.1,0.1
1,35,receiver,we have to uh create the class the name class as the file name.,-0.2,0.2
1,36,receiver,file name.,0,0
1,37,receiver,but I'm not sure whether the quick start is not the same name as task 1.,-0.1,0.1
1,38,receiver,"but, it's still OK.",0.2,0.2
1,39,receiver,hmm.,0,0
1,40,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,41,receiver,I just read it persistent bugger like your function.,0.1,0.1
1,42,receiver,yeah. and.,0,0
1,43,receiver,uh and.,-0.1,0.1
1,44,receiver,uh OK.,0.5,0.5
1,45,receiver,"so, we have two functions for.",-0.1,0.1
1,46,receiver,the first function is checking that number of digits and another function is splitting the character of each digit and multiply them.,-0.5,0.5
1,47,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,48,receiver,that sounds good.,0.8,0.8
1,49,receiver,Let me change the function name to be check number of digit.,-0.3,0.3
1,50,receiver,"so, you have digit to string.",-0.1,0.1
1,51,receiver,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,52,receiver,you can.,0,0
1,53,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,54,receiver,"so, so, I think it should be a while loop instead of for.",-0.4,0.4
1,55,receiver,because we don't know when we will be finished.,-0.3,0.3
1,56,receiver,it’s only checking weather if.,-0.4,0.4
1,57,receiver,you’re right.,0.4,0.4
1,58,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,59,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,60,receiver,"the index equal to zero you mean ah the index of the character, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,61,receiver,each character.,0.1,0.1
1,62,receiver,each digit.,0,0
1,63,receiver,"no. actually, I think we should have a for inside.",-0.4,0.4
1,64,receiver,sorry I removed your code.,-0.5,0.5
1,65,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,66,receiver,maybe index equal to zero and num length and index plus plus i.,-0.1,0.1
1,67,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,68,receiver,I got your point.,0.2,0.2
1,69,receiver,at this time we have to loop for all of characters.,-0.5,0.5
1,70,receiver,we have and convert it 1 by 1.,0,0
1,71,receiver,uh-huh and then let me think.,-0.5,0.5
1,72,receiver,is that Infinity loop you know? because the number is always greater than one.,-0.3,0.3
1,73,receiver,so we have to.,-0.1,0.1
1,74,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,75,receiver,let’s comment out like this.,0.3,0.3
1,76,receiver,right.,0.3,0.3
1,77,receiver,I just.,0,0
1,78,receiver,sorry.,-0.8,0.8
1,79,receiver,maybe make this one.,0,0
1,80,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,81,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,82,receiver,as you want.,0.7,0.7
1,83,receiver,Never mind.,0.1,0.1
1,84,receiver,you've got two.,0.2,0.2
1,85,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,86,receiver,we can comment out.,0.1,0.1
1,87,receiver,you got two.,0,0
1,88,receiver,and we uh loop for every digit and then.  because uh if you see this one 39 is 3 * 9 and do like this until it's changed should be 1 digit.,-0.3,0.3
1,89,receiver,am I wrong?,-0.3,0.3
1,90,receiver,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,91,receiver,I try I. I think that.,0,0
1,92,receiver,"from me, is the outer loop while loop is cover all of this one.",0,0
1,93,receiver,but inner loop is only one it just converts character.,-0.4,0.4
1,94,receiver,"and then, put two multiply each other.",-0.1,0.1
1,95,receiver,"now, we have to each one of these should be.",0,0
1,96,receiver,but it is integer.,-0.2,0.2
1,97,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,98,receiver,number integer number of digits.,0,0
1,99,receiver,we can.,0,0
1,100,receiver,integer dot to string is.,-0.2,0.2
1,101,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,102,receiver,uh let me see.,-0.1,0.1
1,103,receiver,tell me.,-0.2,0.2
1,104,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,105,receiver,ha ha string and address.,0,0
1,106,receiver,one moment.,0.4,0.4
1,107,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,108,receiver,then we need do it again.,-0.4,0.4
1,109,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,110,receiver,"so, the the result is string, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,111,receiver,oh sorry.,-0.5,0.5
1,112,receiver,ah that's my bad.,-0.8,0.8
1,113,receiver,I understand that what is the issue again.,-0.3,0.3
1,114,receiver,oh really?,-0.3,0.3
1,115,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,116,receiver,"So what you mean is is while, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,117,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,118,receiver,I've got one.,0,0
1,119,receiver,And another one we got eight.,0,0
1,120,receiver,"oh, cool!",0.9,0.9
1,121,receiver,"oh it looks like we have no need to use for row, right?",-0.5,0.5
1,122,receiver,"we can do maybe something like this, int while equal to one.",0,0
1,123,receiver,"then, can we do something like this.",-0.2,0.2
1,124,receiver,"and then after a while, then the time.",-0.4,0.4
1,125,receiver,uh because we need to run this function again and then because we need to convert this multiplier into string again and then check if  it’s more than one blah blah.,-0.6,0.6
1,126,receiver,than should go like this?,-0.4,0.4
1,127,receiver,I mean in the example.,-0.1,0.1
1,128,receiver,"so is the multiply by 27, right?",0,0
1,129,receiver,and then result is convert to the to string again.,-0.1,0.1
1,130,receiver,is I'm right?,0,0
1,131,receiver,uh.,0,0
1,132,receiver,Oh.,0.2,0.2
1,133,receiver,you already got what the.,-0.1,0.1
1,134,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,135,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,136,receiver,that's why I'm writing in.,-0.3,0.3
1,137,receiver,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,138,receiver,Sorry.,-0.7,0.7
1,139,receiver,index is not given to us.,-0.8,0.8
1,140,receiver,index is not given to us.,-0.8,0.8
1,141,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,142,receiver,we have to divide by ourselves.,-0.6,0.6
1,143,receiver,if it's equal.,0,0
1,144,receiver,The length is divided by two.,-0.1,0.1
1,145,receiver,uh yes.,0.7,0.7
1,146,receiver,round down I think yes yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,147,receiver,Math dot round.,0,0
1,148,receiver,"floor, because round may be round up.",-0.2,0.2
1,149,receiver,dot floor return double.,-0.3,0.3
1,150,receiver,we have to and.,-0.1,0.1
1,151,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,152,receiver,almost ready.,0.4,0.4
1,153,receiver,"And is that OK or not? because of our array length, 12345618.",-0.1,0.1
1,154,receiver,so the length is 8 / 2 is 4.,0,0
1,155,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,156,receiver,that's fine.,0.4,0.4
1,157,receiver,oh. that's fine or not?,0,0
1,158,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,159,receiver,that's fine.,0.4,0.4
1,160,receiver,because we used a greater than and start by zero. should be 023.,-0.4,0.4
1,161,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,162,receiver,"cool. and the results, we have to return.",0.6,0.6
1,163,receiver,we have to return the position that makes two side equal to each other.,-0.5,0.5
1,164,receiver,position is OK.,0.2,0.2
1,165,receiver,"some if true, we can we can return index.",-0.2,0.2
1,166,receiver,"actually, I think it's OK. is OK.",0.3,0.3
1,167,receiver,to reach the maximum is the number of array divide one by two.,0,0
1,168,receiver,but we can stop before right I guess.,-0.1,0.1
1,169,receiver,and I’m not sure that in this programming language write like this or not.,-0.5,0.5
1,170,receiver,we can create something like boolean is equal to false and false.,-0.7,0.7
1,171,receiver,yes. and set is equal to true.,0.5,0.5
1,172,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,173,receiver,exactly.,0.6,0.6
1,174,receiver,"and we have to return the index, right?",-0.6,0.6
1,175,receiver,the index position.,-0.1,0.1
1,176,receiver,"So, we should define the index.",-0.3,0.3
1,177,receiver,no. should define i before going to the loop. and we can return.,-0.4,0.4
1,178,receiver,"no, sorry.",-0.8,0.8
1,179,receiver,my fault.,-0.9,0.9
1,180,receiver,we can also break.,0.1,0.1
1,181,receiver,I think we can return here because it's already found and we can return i.,0.4,0.4
1,182,receiver,"So, we have to traverse and until the mid of the array, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,183,receiver,so then you're right.,-0.1,0.1
1,184,receiver,should be like this.,0.8,0.8
1,185,receiver,"No. in your case uh, we have to traverse until.",-0.4,0.4
1,186,receiver,"no actually uh, calculate like this works only when size is the same size.",-0.6,0.6
1,187,receiver,"But, what I mean is in our case uh if we have abcde  or the first we should to calculate a and b plus c plus d plus e. not.",-0.4,0.4
1,188,receiver,We go to the first to another group like a plus b and calculate c plus d plus e plus is the same one.,0.4,0.4
1,189,receiver,Not go further.,-0.6,0.6
1,190,receiver,"But, this loop does not have behavior like this.",-0.8,0.8
1,191,receiver,Do you get it?,0,0
1,192,receiver,"So, we have to first maybe maybe two loops.",-0.2,0.2
1,193,receiver,uh let's try.,0,0
1,194,receiver,Never mind.,0.1,0.1
1,195,receiver,That's OK.,0.3,0.3
1,196,receiver,Then let me try.,-0.4,0.4
1,197,receiver,you know this.,0,0
1,198,receiver,One moment.,0.4,0.4
1,199,receiver,Let me try a calculation in a couple minutes.,0.1,0.1
1,200,receiver,Are you saying you have a problem? if we calculate like I mean some of the array.,-0.6,0.6
1,201,receiver,It means if we go from the left side and the right side at the same pace.,-0.1,0.1
1,202,receiver,Do you know what I mean?,0,0
1,203,receiver,"a b c d e. but what I understand is like if we start from the left side and calculate for the left side and every time, we calculate the left side calculate all right side or no we have the same.",-0.3,0.3
1,204,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,205,receiver,you we can try your solution first.,0,0
1,206,receiver,ok.,0.7,0.7
1,207,receiver,let’s try.,0.2,0.2
1,208,receiver,here try let’s put the.,0,0
1,209,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,210,receiver,I will try.,0.1,0.1

1,217,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,218,receiver,come on.,-0.4,0.4
1,219,receiver,It said index out of range.,-0.5,0.5
1,220,receiver,get index range.,-0.1,0.1
1,221,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,222,receiver,let's see debug step by step.,0.1,0.1
1,223,receiver,and we got index 4 for go inside.,0,0
1,224,receiver,four.,0.1,0.1
1,225,receiver,yes. and then they explore.,0,0
1,226,receiver,oh because of we use length.,0,0
1,227,receiver,oh should have because this thing is equal to 8 minus zero.,-0.2,0.2
1,228,receiver,minus zero.,-0.7,0.7
1,229,receiver,it's gone.,-0.7,0.7
1,230,receiver,I already.,-0.1,0.1
1,231,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,232,receiver,"let's see another one, here.",0,0
1,233,receiver,"should be equal, should be minus one because the array starts from zero you know what I mean?",-0.7,0.7
1,234,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,235,receiver,ah yes.,0.7,0.7
1,236,receiver,it should be enough i minus one.,-0.7,0.7
1,237,receiver,now it will.,-0.1,0.1
1,238,receiver,now I change it to 6.,0.1,0.1
1,239,receiver,now it should return 2.,-0.6,0.6
1,240,receiver,we couldn't finish the second one.,-0.6,0.6

1,27,sender,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,28,sender,I forgot.,-0.1,0.1
1,29,sender,Have you installed live share in your with code extension?,0,0
1,30,sender,or actually you can join by browser.,0,0

1,38,sender,Let’s create the first file.,0.2,0.2
1,39,sender,how to write Java?,-0.1,0.1
1,40,sender,let's see.,0,0
1,41,sender,we'll see the instructions first.,0,0
1,42,sender,"Yeah, we can press on control, shift, and P for Java trips for beginners.",0.4,0.4
1,43,sender,"So, for quick start, Java entry, create a file, and you can now put the code into a file and press F5 to run in the integrated terminal.",0.3,0.3
1,44,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,45,sender,"firstly, open the terminal and the file.",0,0
1,46,sender,You still have to rename it.,-0.5,0.5
1,47,sender,You also need to rename the java file.,-0.5,0.5
1,48,sender,I have a run.,-0.1,0.1

1,55,sender,"now, we are in this line and we can debug it line by line.",0.2,0.2
1,56,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,57,sender,it workes.,-0.1,0.1
1,58,sender,let’s start with the first task.,0,0

1,60,sender,you can also open on your computer and read it.,0.7,0.7
1,61,sender,"and, we can talk to confirm our understanding together.",0.4,0.4
1,62,sender,"ah, I can write it first.",0.1,0.1
1,63,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,64,sender,the first task is the convert string to camel case from dash and underscore.,0,0
1,65,sender,I think it's just like uh eliminate underscore or dash and change the first character to be the capitalized.,-0.1,0.1
1,66,sender,"but, the problem is why this one is not capitalized.",-0.7,0.7
1,67,sender,"Camel casing, the first character should be.",0,0
1,68,sender,the first character should be the capital letter.,-0.1,0.1
1,69,sender,"So let's see JAVA ,how to write Java, what's in your mind?",-0.2,0.2
1,70,sender,what flow we have to do it?,0,0
1,71,sender,"for example, first step we have to capitalize.",-0.3,0.3
1,72,sender,no. first that we have to eliminate dash and underscore.,-0.3,0.3
1,73,sender,right.,0.3,0.3
1,74,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,75,sender,let me write a brief steps.,-0.1,0.1
1,76,sender,"eliminate dash and underscore ,right?",-0.2,0.2
1,77,sender,and the second one is changing the first character.,0,0
1,78,sender,you can also guide me you if you have ideas.,0.8,0.8
1,79,sender,hello.,0.2,0.2
1,80,sender,are you still with me or do you have any other ideas?,-0.2,0.2
1,81,sender,"you mean that Java library have the method to change into Camelcase, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,82,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,83,sender,"while you are searching, I will try to create a function I wish to.",0,0
1,84,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,85,sender,what I just wrote is only replace dash to blank and underscore to blank.,-0.7,0.7
1,86,sender,and do you have any idea how to convert to camel case?,-0.1,0.1
1,87,sender,hmm.,0,0
1,88,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,89,sender,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,90,sender,you cannot write you have no permission.,-0.8,0.8
1,91,sender,"oh , you have read only.",-0.3,0.3
1,92,sender,how should I know.,-0.3,0.3
1,93,sender,oh.,0.2,0.2

1,97,sender,why?,-0.5,0.5
1,98,sender,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,99,sender,convert.,0,0
1,100,sender,"oh, I have an idea like this whenever we found that or we changed next one after that underscore be the capitalized.",0,0
1,101,sender,and I think it's the same as you.,0.2,0.2
1,102,sender,would.,0.1,0.1
1,103,sender,Oh.,0.2,0.2
1,104,sender,"yeah, I want to write check the length and here check each character.",0,0
1,105,sender,after that we should convert to capitalize.,-0.5,0.5
1,106,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,107,sender,"and then, continue.",0,0
1,108,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,109,sender,"So, what we have to revise is this one because we have to focus on both dash or underscore.",-0.3,0.3
1,110,sender,And try to put some text like?,-0.2,0.2
1,111,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,112,sender,and change.,-0.2,0.2

1,134,sender,you.,0.1,0.1
1,135,sender,here.,0,0
1,136,sender,I have to do the second part?,-0.1,0.1
1,137,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,138,sender,Let me read.,-0.2,0.2
1,139,sender,I didn't understand the task.,-0.7,0.7
1,140,sender,I mean.,-0.1,0.1
1,141,sender,I mean the task description I don't understand like what does it come from us on the second task.,-0.6,0.6
1,142,sender,Ah.,0,0
1,143,sender,"so, I understand.",0,0
1,144,sender,"so, the result is a number of times, right? because the first one is 1* 5, uh 3 * 9, another one is here and here until we reach the only one digit.",-0.3,0.3
1,145,sender,It takes three times.,-0.6,0.6
1,146,sender,another one takes two times.,-0.6,0.6
1,147,sender,and third one is zero time.,-0.5,0.5
1,148,sender,it’s already one digit.,-0.2,0.2
1,149,sender,what are you doing you?,-0.2,0.2
1,150,sender,are trying to create a new function ?,-0.2,0.2
1,151,sender,"uh, let's discuss the step first.",-0.2,0.2
1,152,sender,you have to.,0.1,0.1
1,153,sender,the idea is to convert digit to string first to then check its length.,-0.1,0.1
1,154,sender,"if it's more than one, then we need to continue the process.",-0.1,0.1
1,155,sender,"so, we will check the the length of that and within the of each item of the array.",-0.1,0.1
1,156,sender,"I mean, the character of the string.",0,0
1,157,sender,"then, convert it to integer again.",-0.2,0.2
1,158,sender,"then, multiplied by it.",0,0
1,159,sender,"then, uh do it again and again until we reached the single digit.",-0.1,0.1
1,160,sender,does it a sound good?,-0.1,0.1
1,161,sender,I'm sorry Uh.,-0.7,0.7
1,162,sender,"so, this function is your main task that loops for your number, right?",-0.3,0.3
1,163,sender,let’s write all of them here.,0.1,0.1
1,164,sender,"so, we can cut it.",0,0
1,165,sender,"and then, put it in the second method.",0,0
1,166,sender,whether there is only one character.,-0.3,0.3
1,167,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,168,sender,it can be changed from this to this.,-0.2,0.2
1,169,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,170,sender,right.,0.3,0.3
1,171,sender,and while for the number of length and greater than one.,0,0
1,172,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,173,sender,"um then we also need int, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,174,sender,and then um.,0,0
1,175,sender,uh yes.,0.7,0.7
1,176,sender,do we have to integer function or to convert to integer ?,-0.1,0.1
1,177,sender,Oh yeah.,0.8,0.8
1,178,sender,I think we did something wrong in here.,-0.8,0.8
1,179,sender,yeah. or we didn't?,0,0
1,180,sender,can we just do a just test it here?,0,0
1,181,sender,I'm not sure if it is well no not for example.,-0.4,0.4
1,182,sender,uh no.,-0.3,0.3
1,183,sender,I just want to test this one.,0,0
1,184,sender,and how to run this ?,-0.3,0.3
1,185,sender,I just want to and  they can just like.,0.7,0.7
1,186,sender,or do you want to?,0,0
1,187,sender,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,188,sender,"then then, try to I want to get what's the result for this.",-0.3,0.3
1,189,sender,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,190,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,191,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,192,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,193,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,194,sender,sorry.,-0.8,0.8
1,195,sender,why do you write a for within the loop within the while?,-0.5,0.5
1,196,sender,why?,-0.5,0.5
1,197,sender,I have another idea for that.,0.1,0.1
1,198,sender,"actually, without a while loop.",0.2,0.2
1,199,sender,but it's OK.,0.2,0.2
1,200,sender,no problem.,0.6,0.6
1,201,sender,"it is num, isn’t it?",-0.2,0.2
1,202,sender,can I try this one.,-0.1,0.1
1,203,sender,can you run this?,-0.1,0.1
1,204,sender,how about this one?,-0.2,0.2
1,205,sender,can you run it again?,-0.3,0.3
1,206,sender,you maybe have to cast it first.,-0.1,0.1
1,207,sender,I’m not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,208,sender,should be string instead of array I think.,-0.5,0.5
1,209,sender,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,210,sender,that should be array string and then while loop and then move.,-0.4,0.4
1,211,sender,It just oh remove this one and remove this one and then digit parse int.,-0.7,0.7
1,212,sender,ahha.,0.2,0.2
1,213,sender,"And just use index like you wrote at the first, equal to zero.",-0.5,0.5
1,214,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,215,sender,cool! and then we have to.,0.8,0.8
1,216,sender,we have.,-0.1,0.1
1,217,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,218,sender,we have.,-0.1,0.1
1,219,sender,we have to write a for loop inside because we have to multiply each other together.,-0.3,0.3
1,220,sender,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,221,sender,"actually, we can.",0.3,0.3
1,222,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,223,sender,no. actually we have to return index.,-0.6,0.6
1,224,sender,"no, we have to return the index because the question asked the number of times.",-0.6,0.6
1,225,sender,mm-hmm yes.,0.4,0.4
1,226,sender,right.,0.3,0.3
1,227,sender,right.,0.3,0.3
1,228,sender,right.,0.3,0.3
1,229,sender,So what we have to return this is the multiplier.,-0.6,0.6
1,230,sender,"yes, multiplier.",0,0
1,231,sender,so if you say like that.,-0.5,0.5
1,232,sender,we have to change while loop to an if.,-0.4,0.4
1,233,sender,am I correct?,0,0
1,234,sender,"if. and, OK.",0,0
1,235,sender,the time is up.,-0.1,0.1
1,236,sender,I think we can.,0.3,0.3
1,237,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,238,sender,let's create a task 3.,-0.1,0.1
1,239,sender,"and let’s get started with, the with, the task description.",0.1,0.1
1,240,sender,I found something like this.,0.7,0.7
1,241,sender,does work in my locals working.,0,0
1,242,sender,"So then, no worries.",0.4,0.4
1,243,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,244,sender,boolean.,0.2,0.2
1,245,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,246,sender,"our flow is can you walk through each array for the each of the element of the array, right?",0,0
1,247,sender,"and try to calculate both sides and finish whenever it is equal for the both sides, right?",-0.1,0.1
1,248,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,249,sender,Uh you didn't put in the function.,-0.8,0.8
1,250,sender,I’m just curious that what’s the error is this.,-0.7,0.7
1,251,sender,"And, I’m trying to help.",-0.1,0.1
1,252,sender,"And, input in to the main function.",0,0
1,253,sender,I think this one is incorrect.,-0.8,0.8
1,254,sender,"it should be changed to i, right? because if it's fixed to be one you will start only last.",-0.7,0.7
1,255,sender,No problem.,0.6,0.6
1,256,sender,That's OK.,0.3,0.3
1,257,sender,I’ve never tried to.,-0.3,0.3
1,258,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,259,sender,"so, the number of new is the index divided by 2.",0,0
1,260,sender,Is that correct?,-0.2,0.2
1,261,sender,oh OK.,0.4,0.4
1,262,sender,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,263,sender,uh my logic is completely wrong.,-0.9,0.9
1,264,sender,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,265,sender,you are right.,0.4,0.4
1,266,sender,and if it is another function then.,-0.3,0.3
1,267,sender,and then should be math dot around or something like this.,-0.1,0.1
1,268,sender,It should be floor.,-0.4,0.4
1,269,sender,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,270,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,271,sender,Is that correct?,-0.2,0.2
1,272,sender,Array dot length.,0,0
1,273,sender,It has never used.,-0.5,0.5
1,274,sender,OK uh if it return double OK Umm sorry.,-0.6,0.6
1,275,sender,double.,0,0
1,276,sender,index.,0,0
1,277,sender,you are right.,0.4,0.4
1,278,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,279,sender,you can put in front of me. is it good?,0,0
1,280,sender,"digits, we send the index here.",0,0
1,281,sender,"Then, what we are checksum.",-0.3,0.3
1,282,sender,oh OK.,0.4,0.4
1,283,sender,return a position.,-0.2,0.2
1,284,sender,I think we have died from the game.,-0.6,0.6
1,285,sender,"so we don't, we don't need to calculate.",-0.4,0.4
1,286,sender,"we don't, we don't need.",-0.6,0.6
1,287,sender,we need to divide by two.,-0.4,0.4
1,288,sender,we first need to go to with the.,-0.1,0.1
1,289,sender,uh I think we can do something like this.,0,0
1,290,sender,if is equal to.,0,0
1,291,sender,and we need to break from the loop function.,-0.4,0.4
1,292,sender,what is the next one? for example what if like this 1 1 is equal.,0,0
1,293,sender,and then 3 3 is equal.,0,0
1,294,sender,but all 6 6  is also equal.,0,0
1,295,sender,"but in our case, if do not calculate the one because it will say that OK.",-0.4,0.4
1,296,sender,"it is fine, then it will break.",-0.4,0.4
1,297,sender,I have one more idea.,0.2,0.2
1,298,sender,I can run down.,-0.5,0.5
1,299,sender,you can continue there.,0.4,0.4
1,300,sender,"afterwards, check Umm.",-0.2,0.2
1,301,sender,I but what.,-0.2,0.2
1,302,sender,if but after the first iteration if you stop that station.,-0.3,0.3
1,303,sender,you know what I mean?,0,0
1,304,sender,"so, let's say that index is one and the i is one.",-0.1,0.1
1,305,sender,"and then, we get the first element and the last element, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,306,sender,"And then, some first will be one, some last will be one.",-0.1,0.1
1,307,sender,"Then, if you check if equal then break or return index to stop.",-0.6,0.6
1,308,sender,It will not go further this.,-0.7,0.7
1,309,sender,It could be.,0,0
1,310,sender,I think I have an idea again.,0.6,0.6
1,311,sender,"So, we can sum first equal to sum last.",0,0
1,312,sender,Then is equal equal to true.,0,0
1,313,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,314,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,315,sender,and then it came here the next step.,0,0
1,316,sender,else if sum fist is not equal sum last and is equal equal to true return i minus one.,-0.3,0.3
1,317,sender,"If not equal, otherwise, continue.",-0.3,0.3
1,318,sender,What about this one?,-0.3,0.3
1,319,sender,We are the same also dropdown.,0,0
1,320,sender,this array length minus one is the last item.,-0.5,0.5
1,321,sender,"So, in the first iteration, we get one from the first.",0,0
1,322,sender,And then we get one from the last.,-0.2,0.2
1,323,sender,And then we add the first one to here and the last one to here.,-0.1,0.1
1,324,sender,and then compare it.,-0.4,0.4
1,325,sender,if it is equal to the is equal to true and then in the next step.,0.1,0.1
1,326,sender,for example.,0,0
1,327,sender,"for example, it is now 2, and then it will continue at true here and add another one from the last second to here.",-0.1,0.1
1,328,sender,both of them sum first sum it again 3 is equal.,0.1,0.1
1,329,sender,"so it equal to true again, it can continues until it's exact equal.",0.1,0.1
1,330,sender,"and if it is not equal, and then the previous value of this equal.",0,0
1,331,sender,it’s also true so. that means the previous iteration was correct.,0.1,0.1
1,332,sender,and there is another step after that.,-0.3,0.3
1,333,sender,"So, then it should to return that index minus one.",-0.8,0.8
1,334,sender,"I think, maybe we can just try check them out.",0,0
1,335,sender,"yeah then if it doesn't work, then we can continue with yours.",0.1,0.1
1,336,sender,"we have the double index instead what we have trying, not it does it.",-0.3,0.3
1,337,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,338,sender,"now, can you run?",-0.2,0.2
1,339,sender,I hope it will work.,0.1,0.1
1,340,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,341,sender,now let's continue with yours.,0.3,0.3
1,342,sender,index four?,0,0
1,343,sender,Ok.,0.6,0.6
1,344,sender,why zero minus i.,-0.3,0.3
1,345,sender,where is the debugger right now.,-0.6,0.6
1,346,sender,OK just go one step forward.,0,0
1,347,sender,should be one then.,-0.4,0.4
1,348,sender,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,349,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,350,sender,yeah that's fine.,0.7,0.7
1,351,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,352,sender,"just really, so it's true.",0.5,0.5
1,353,sender,"but should not be true, can you run again.",-0.7,0.7
1,354,sender,what thing you have changed.,-0.3,0.3
1,355,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,356,sender,let’s change to second one.,0,0
1,357,sender,it could be.,0,0
1,358,sender,"should be zero, right?",-0.5,0.5
1,359,sender,Your length should be.,-0.1,0.1
1,360,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,361,sender,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,362,sender,you're right.,0.4,0.4
1,363,sender,wow we finished!,0.9,0.9

1,53,whole conversation,"firstly, open the terminal and the file.",0,0
1,54,whole conversation,You still have to rename it.,-0.5,0.5
1,55,whole conversation,You also need to rename the java file.,-0.5,0.5
1,56,whole conversation,Here.,0,0
1,57,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3

1,76,whole conversation,"ah, I can write it first.",0.1,0.1
1,77,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,78,whole conversation,the first task is the convert string to camel case from dash and underscore.,0,0
1,79,whole conversation,I think it's just like uh eliminate underscore or dash and change the first character to be the capitalized.,-0.1,0.1
1,80,whole conversation,"but, the problem is why this one is not capitalized.",-0.7,0.7
1,81,whole conversation,"Camel casing, the first character should be.",0,0
1,82,whole conversation,the first character should be the capital letter.,-0.1,0.1
1,83,whole conversation,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,84,whole conversation,I think so.,0,0
1,85,whole conversation,"So let's see JAVA ,how to write Java, what's in your mind?",-0.2,0.2
1,86,whole conversation,what flow we have to do it?,0,0
1,87,whole conversation,"for example, first step we have to capitalize.",-0.3,0.3
1,88,whole conversation,no. first that we have to eliminate dash and underscore.,-0.3,0.3
1,89,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
1,90,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,91,whole conversation,let me write a brief steps.,-0.1,0.1
1,92,whole conversation,"eliminate dash and underscore ,right?",-0.2,0.2
1,93,whole conversation,and the second one is changing the first character.,0,0
1,94,whole conversation,you can also guide me you if you have ideas.,0.8,0.8
1,95,whole conversation,hello.,0.2,0.2
1,96,whole conversation,are you still with me or do you have any other ideas?,-0.2,0.2
1,97,whole conversation,I was checking on the Google that if there has a specific method for that.,-0.2,0.2
1,98,whole conversation,"you mean that Java library have the method to change into Camelcase, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,99,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,100,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,101,whole conversation,"while you are searching, I will try to create a function I wish to.",0,0
1,102,whole conversation,I search from google or somewhere.,0,0
1,103,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,104,whole conversation,what I just wrote is only replace dash to blank and underscore to blank.,-0.7,0.7
1,105,whole conversation,and do you have any idea how to convert to camel case?,-0.1,0.1
1,106,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,107,whole conversation,I have found the function for that.,0.2,0.2
1,108,whole conversation,hmm. should I copy paste there ?,-0.1,0.1
1,109,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,110,whole conversation,I cannot.,-0.7,0.7
1,111,whole conversation,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,112,whole conversation,you cannot write you have no permission.,-0.8,0.8
1,113,whole conversation,"oh , you have read only.",-0.3,0.3
1,114,whole conversation,how should I know.,-0.3,0.3
1,115,whole conversation,maybe if you click on the read only.,-0.3,0.3
1,116,whole conversation,maybe you can change it to write access.,-0.2,0.2
1,117,whole conversation,oh.,0.2,0.2
1,118,whole conversation,here read only.,-0.2,0.2
1,119,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,120,whole conversation,I still cannot.,-0.7,0.7
1,121,whole conversation,This is a shared terminal.,-0.1,0.1
1,122,whole conversation,why?,-0.5,0.5
1,123,whole conversation,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,124,whole conversation,"now, we can use.",0.6,0.6
1,125,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,126,whole conversation,"sorry, I think that is my bad.",-0.8,0.8
1,127,whole conversation,I was watching from the zoom.,-0.1,0.1
1,128,whole conversation,I thought that is the same screen.,-0.5,0.5
1,129,whole conversation,convert.,0,0
1,130,whole conversation,"oh, I have an idea like this whenever we found that or we changed next one after that underscore be the capitalized.",0,0
1,131,whole conversation,and I think it's the same as you.,0.2,0.2
1,132,whole conversation,would.,0.1,0.1
1,133,whole conversation,Oh.,0.2,0.2
1,134,whole conversation,"yeah, I want to write check the length and here check each character.",0,0
1,135,whole conversation,after that we should convert to capitalize.,-0.5,0.5
1,136,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,137,whole conversation,"and then, continue.",0,0
1,138,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,139,whole conversation,"So, what we have to revise is this one because we have to focus on both dash or underscore.",-0.3,0.3
1,140,whole conversation,And try to put some text like?,-0.2,0.2
1,141,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,142,whole conversation,and change.,-0.2,0.2
1,143,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,144,whole conversation,let's try.,0.2,0.2
1,145,whole conversation,we got this.,0,0
1,146,whole conversation,can you see my terminal?,0,0
1,147,whole conversation,mm-hmm OK.,0.5,0.5
1,148,whole conversation,I input the steal warrior.,-0.1,0.1
1,149,whole conversation,and this is the same as this.,-0.3,0.3
1,150,whole conversation,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,151,whole conversation,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,152,whole conversation,And another one is to change this here and see what's happened.,-0.6,0.6
1,153,whole conversation,the result is Oh here.,0,0
1,154,whole conversation,still here.,-0.1,0.1
1,155,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,156,whole conversation,it's the same.,-0.1,0.1
1,157,whole conversation,we're good.,0.7,0.7
1,158,whole conversation,"yeah, we've got it, the first task.",0.1,0.1
1,159,whole conversation,"The next task, task two.",0,0
1,160,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,161,whole conversation,you can try to be the driver.,0.1,0.1
1,162,whole conversation,"now, I can help.",0.7,0.7
1,163,whole conversation,come on.,-0.4,0.4
1,164,whole conversation,you.,0.1,0.1
1,165,whole conversation,here.,0,0
1,166,whole conversation,I have to do the second part?,-0.1,0.1
1,167,whole conversation,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,168,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,169,whole conversation,Let me read.,-0.2,0.2
1,170,whole conversation,I didn't understand the task.,-0.7,0.7
1,171,whole conversation,uh it's just the recommendation.,0.6,0.6
1,172,whole conversation,It is the rule of the java.,-0.1,0.1
1,173,whole conversation,we have to uh create the class the name class as the file name.,-0.2,0.2
1,174,whole conversation,file name.,0,0
1,175,whole conversation,but I'm not sure whether the quick start is not the same name as task 1.,-0.1,0.1
1,176,whole conversation,"but, it's still OK.",0.2,0.2
1,177,whole conversation,I mean.,-0.1,0.1
1,178,whole conversation,I mean the task description I don't understand like what does it come from us on the second task.,-0.6,0.6
1,179,whole conversation,hmm.,0,0
1,180,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,181,whole conversation,I just read it persistent bugger like your function.,0.1,0.1
1,182,whole conversation,Ah.,0,0
1,183,whole conversation,"so, I understand.",0,0
1,184,whole conversation,"so, the result is a number of times, right? because the first one is 1* 5, uh 3 * 9, another one is here and here until we reach the only one digit.",-0.3,0.3
1,185,whole conversation,It takes three times.,-0.6,0.6
1,186,whole conversation,another one takes two times.,-0.6,0.6
1,187,whole conversation,and third one is zero time.,-0.5,0.5
1,188,whole conversation,it’s already one digit.,-0.2,0.2
1,189,whole conversation,what are you doing you?,-0.2,0.2
1,190,whole conversation,are trying to create a new function ?,-0.2,0.2
1,191,whole conversation,yeah. and.,0,0
1,192,whole conversation,uh and.,-0.1,0.1
1,193,whole conversation,"uh, let's discuss the step first.",-0.2,0.2
1,194,whole conversation,you have to.,0.1,0.1
1,195,whole conversation,the idea is to convert digit to string first to then check its length.,-0.1,0.1
1,196,whole conversation,"if it's more than one, then we need to continue the process.",-0.1,0.1
1,197,whole conversation,"so, we will check the the length of that and within the of each item of the array.",-0.1,0.1
1,198,whole conversation,"I mean, the character of the string.",0,0
1,199,whole conversation,"then, convert it to integer again.",-0.2,0.2
1,200,whole conversation,"then, multiplied by it.",0,0
1,201,whole conversation,"then, uh do it again and again until we reached the single digit.",-0.1,0.1
1,202,whole conversation,does it a sound good?,-0.1,0.1
1,203,whole conversation,uh OK.,0.5,0.5
1,204,whole conversation,"so, we have two functions for.",-0.1,0.1
1,205,whole conversation,the first function is checking that number of digits and another function is splitting the character of each digit and multiply them.,-0.5,0.5
1,206,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,207,whole conversation,that sounds good.,0.8,0.8
1,208,whole conversation,Let me change the function name to be check number of digit.,-0.3,0.3
1,209,whole conversation,"so, you have digit to string.",-0.1,0.1
1,210,whole conversation,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,211,whole conversation,you can.,0,0
1,212,whole conversation,I'm sorry Uh.,-0.7,0.7
1,213,whole conversation,"so, this function is your main task that loops for your number, right?",-0.3,0.3
1,214,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,215,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,216,whole conversation,the main task.,-0.3,0.3
1,217,whole conversation,let’s write all of them here.,0.1,0.1
1,218,whole conversation,"so, we can cut it.",0,0
1,219,whole conversation,"and then, put it in the second method.",0,0
1,220,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,221,whole conversation,"so, so, I think it should be a while loop instead of for.",-0.4,0.4
1,222,whole conversation,because we don't know when we will be finished.,-0.3,0.3
1,223,whole conversation,it’s only checking weather if.,-0.4,0.4
1,224,whole conversation,you’re right.,0.4,0.4
1,225,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,226,whole conversation,whether there is only one character.,-0.3,0.3
1,227,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,228,whole conversation,it can be changed from this to this.,-0.2,0.2
1,229,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,230,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
1,231,whole conversation,and while for the number of length and greater than one.,0,0
1,232,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,233,whole conversation,"um then we also need int, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,234,whole conversation,yes.  and then um.,0,0
1,235,whole conversation,"the index equal to zero you mean ah the index of the character, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,236,whole conversation,each character.,0.1,0.1
1,237,whole conversation,each digit.,0,0
1,238,whole conversation,uh yes.,0.7,0.7
1,239,whole conversation,do we have to integer function or to convert to integer ?,-0.1,0.1
1,240,whole conversation,uh let me think.,0,0
1,241,whole conversation,uh because it is is the main function maybe integer dot parse int convert digit.,-0.2,0.2
1,242,whole conversation,Oh yeah.,0.8,0.8
1,243,whole conversation,"no. actually, I think we should have a for inside.",-0.4,0.4
1,244,whole conversation,sorry I removed your code.,-0.5,0.5
1,245,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,246,whole conversation,maybe index equal to zero and num length and index plus plus i.,-0.1,0.1
1,247,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,248,whole conversation,I got your point.,0.2,0.2
1,249,whole conversation,at this time we have to loop for all of characters.,-0.5,0.5
1,250,whole conversation,we have and convert it 1 by 1.,0,0
1,251,whole conversation,I think we did something wrong in here.,-0.8,0.8
1,252,whole conversation,yeah. or we didn't?,0,0
1,253,whole conversation,can we just do a just test it here?,0,0
1,254,whole conversation,I'm not sure if it is well no not for example.,-0.4,0.4
1,255,whole conversation,uh-huh and then let me think.,-0.5,0.5
1,256,whole conversation,uh no.,-0.3,0.3
1,257,whole conversation,I just want to test this one.,0,0
1,258,whole conversation,and how to run this ? is that Infinity loop you know? because the number is always greater than one.,-0.5,0.5
1,259,whole conversation,so we have to.,-0.1,0.1
1,260,whole conversation,I just want to and  they can just like.,0.7,0.7
1,261,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,262,whole conversation,let’s comment out like this.,0.3,0.3
1,263,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
1,264,whole conversation,or do you want to?,0,0
1,265,whole conversation,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,266,whole conversation,I just.,0,0
1,267,whole conversation,sorry.,-0.8,0.8
1,268,whole conversation,maybe make this one.,0,0
1,269,whole conversation,"then then, try to I want to get what's the result for this.",-0.3,0.3
1,270,whole conversation,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,271,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,272,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,273,whole conversation,as you want.,0.7,0.7
1,274,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,275,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,276,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,277,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,278,whole conversation,sorry.,-0.8,0.8
1,279,whole conversation,Never mind.,0.1,0.1
1,280,whole conversation,you've got two.,0.2,0.2
1,281,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,282,whole conversation,we can comment out.,0.1,0.1
1,283,whole conversation,you got two.,0,0
1,284,whole conversation,and we uh loop for every digit and then.,0,0
1,285,whole conversation,why do you write a for within the loop within the while?,-0.5,0.5
1,286,whole conversation,why?  because uh if you see this one 39 is 3 * 9 and do like this until it's changed should be 1 digit.,-0.5,0.5
1,287,whole conversation,am I wrong?,-0.3,0.3
1,288,whole conversation,I'm not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,289,whole conversation,I try I. I think that.,0,0
1,290,whole conversation,I have another idea for that.,0.1,0.1
1,291,whole conversation,"actually, without a while loop.",0.2,0.2
1,292,whole conversation,but it's OK.,0.2,0.2
1,293,whole conversation,no problem.,0.6,0.6
1,294,whole conversation,"from me, is the outer loop while loop is cover all of this one.",0,0
1,295,whole conversation,but inner loop is only one it just converts character.,-0.4,0.4
1,296,whole conversation,"and then, put two multiply each other.",-0.1,0.1
1,297,whole conversation,"now, we have to each one of these should be.",0,0
1,298,whole conversation,but it is integer.,-0.2,0.2
1,299,whole conversation,"it is num, isn’t it?",-0.2,0.2
1,300,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,301,whole conversation,number integer number of digits.,0,0
1,302,whole conversation,we can.,0,0
1,303,whole conversation,integer dot to string is.,-0.2,0.2
1,304,whole conversation,can I try this one.,-0.1,0.1
1,305,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,306,whole conversation,uh let me see.,-0.1,0.1
1,307,whole conversation,tell me.,-0.2,0.2
1,308,whole conversation,can you run this?,-0.1,0.1
1,309,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,310,whole conversation,ha ha string and address.,0,0
1,311,whole conversation,how about this one?,-0.2,0.2
1,312,whole conversation,can you run it again?,-0.3,0.3
1,313,whole conversation,one moment.,0.4,0.4
1,314,whole conversation,you maybe have to cast it first.,-0.1,0.1
1,315,whole conversation,I’m not sure.,-0.1,0.1
1,316,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,317,whole conversation,then we need do it again.,-0.4,0.4
1,318,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,319,whole conversation,"so, the the result is string, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,320,whole conversation,oh sorry.,-0.5,0.5
1,321,whole conversation,ah that's my bad.,-0.8,0.8
1,322,whole conversation,I understand that what is the issue again.,-0.3,0.3
1,323,whole conversation,should be string instead of array I think.,-0.5,0.5
1,324,whole conversation,oh really?,-0.3,0.3
1,325,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,326,whole conversation,that should be array string and then while loop and then move.,-0.4,0.4
1,327,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,328,whole conversation,"So what you mean is is while, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,329,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,330,whole conversation,I've got one.,0,0
1,331,whole conversation,And another one we got eight.,0,0
1,332,whole conversation,"oh, cool!",0.9,0.9
1,333,whole conversation,It just oh remove this one and remove this one and then digit parse int.,-0.7,0.7
1,334,whole conversation,"oh it looks like we have no need to use for row, right?",-0.5,0.5
1,335,whole conversation,ahha.,0.2,0.2
1,336,whole conversation,"And just use index like you wrote at the first, equal to zero.",-0.5,0.5
1,337,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,338,whole conversation,cool! and then we have to.,0.8,0.8
1,339,whole conversation,we have.,-0.1,0.1
1,340,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,341,whole conversation,we have.,-0.1,0.1
1,342,whole conversation,we have to write a for loop inside because we have to multiply each other together.,-0.3,0.3
1,343,whole conversation,"we can do maybe something like this, int while equal to one.",0,0
1,344,whole conversation,"then, can we do something like this.",-0.2,0.2
1,345,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,346,whole conversation,"actually, we can.",0.3,0.3
1,347,whole conversation,"and then after a while, then the time.",-0.4,0.4
1,348,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,349,whole conversation,no. actually we have to return index.,-0.6,0.6
1,350,whole conversation,"no, we have to return the index because the question asked the number of times.",-0.6,0.6
1,351,whole conversation,uh because we need to run this function again and then because we need to convert this multiplier into string again and then check if  it’s more than one blah blah.,-0.6,0.6
1,352,whole conversation,than should go like this?,-0.4,0.4
1,353,whole conversation,I mean in the example.,-0.1,0.1
1,354,whole conversation,"so is the multiply by 27, right?",0,0
1,355,whole conversation,and then result is convert to the to string again.,-0.1,0.1
1,356,whole conversation,is I'm right?,0,0
1,357,whole conversation,mm-hmm yes.,0.4,0.4
1,358,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
1,359,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
1,360,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
1,361,whole conversation,So what we have to return this is the multiplier.,-0.6,0.6
1,362,whole conversation,"yes, multiplier.",0,0
1,363,whole conversation,R but if it is bigger than one time one not.,-0.2,0.2
1,364,whole conversation,so that one goes like this.,-0.4,0.4
1,365,whole conversation,and then Umm just give.,-0.1,0.1
1,366,whole conversation,so if you say like that.,-0.5,0.5
1,367,whole conversation,we have to change while loop to an if.,-0.4,0.4
1,368,whole conversation,am I correct?,0,0
1,369,whole conversation,uh.,0,0
1,370,whole conversation,"if. and, OK.",0,0
1,371,whole conversation,the time is up.,-0.1,0.1
1,372,whole conversation,I think we can.,0.3,0.3
1,373,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,374,whole conversation,let's create a task 3.,-0.1,0.1
1,375,whole conversation,"and let’s get started with, the with, the task description.",0.1,0.1
1,376,whole conversation,I found something like this.,0.7,0.7
1,377,whole conversation,Oh.,0.2,0.2
1,378,whole conversation,you already got what the.,-0.1,0.1
1,379,whole conversation,does work in my locals working.,0,0
1,380,whole conversation,"So then, no worries.",0.4,0.4
1,381,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,382,whole conversation,boolean.,0.2,0.2
1,383,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,384,whole conversation,"our flow is can you walk through each array for the each of the element of the array, right?",0,0
1,385,whole conversation,"and try to calculate both sides and finish whenever it is equal for the both sides, right?",-0.1,0.1
1,386,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,387,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,388,whole conversation,Uh you didn't put in the function.,-0.8,0.8
1,389,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,390,whole conversation,that's why I'm writing in.,-0.3,0.3
1,391,whole conversation,I’m just curious that what’s the error is this.,-0.7,0.7
1,392,whole conversation,"And, I’m trying to help.",-0.1,0.1
1,393,whole conversation,"And, input in to the main function.",0,0
1,394,whole conversation,I think this one is incorrect.,-0.8,0.8
1,395,whole conversation,"it should be changed to i, right? because if it's fixed to be one you will start only last.",-0.7,0.7
1,396,whole conversation,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,397,whole conversation,Sorry.,-0.7,0.7
1,398,whole conversation,No problem.,0.6,0.6
1,399,whole conversation,That's OK.,0.3,0.3
1,400,whole conversation,I’ve never tried to.,-0.3,0.3
1,401,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,402,whole conversation,"so, the number of new is the index divided by 2.",0,0
1,403,whole conversation,Is that correct?,-0.2,0.2
1,404,whole conversation,index is not given to us.,-0.8,0.8
1,405,whole conversation,index is not given to us.,-0.8,0.8
1,406,whole conversation,oh OK.,0.4,0.4
1,407,whole conversation,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,408,whole conversation,uh my logic is completely wrong.,-0.9,0.9
1,409,whole conversation,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,410,whole conversation,you are right.,0.4,0.4
1,411,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,412,whole conversation,we have to divide by ourselves.,-0.6,0.6
1,413,whole conversation,if it's equal.,0,0
1,414,whole conversation,and if it is another function then.,-0.3,0.3
1,415,whole conversation,The length is divided by two.,-0.1,0.1
1,416,whole conversation,and then should be math dot around or something like this.,-0.1,0.1
1,417,whole conversation,uh yes.,0.7,0.7
1,418,whole conversation,round down I think yes yeah.,0.7,0.7
1,419,whole conversation,Math dot round.,0,0
1,420,whole conversation,It should be floor.,-0.4,0.4
1,421,whole conversation,"floor, because round may be round up.",-0.2,0.2
1,422,whole conversation,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,423,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,424,whole conversation,Is that correct?,-0.2,0.2
1,425,whole conversation,Array dot length.,0,0
1,426,whole conversation,dot floor return double.,-0.3,0.3
1,427,whole conversation,we have to and.,-0.1,0.1
1,428,whole conversation,It has never used.,-0.5,0.5
1,429,whole conversation,OK uh if it return double OK Umm sorry.,-0.6,0.6
1,430,whole conversation,double.,0,0
1,431,whole conversation,index.,0,0
1,432,whole conversation,you are right.,0.4,0.4
1,433,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
1,434,whole conversation,you can put in front of me.,0.1,0.1
1,435,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,436,whole conversation,almost ready.,0.4,0.4
1,437,whole conversation,is it good?,0,0
1,438,whole conversation,"digits, we send the index here.",0,0
1,439,whole conversation,"Then, what we are checksum.",-0.3,0.3
1,440,whole conversation,"And is that OK or not? because of our array length, 12345618.",-0.1,0.1
1,441,whole conversation,so the length is 8 / 2 is 4.,0,0
1,442,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,443,whole conversation,that's fine.,0.4,0.4
1,444,whole conversation,oh. that's fine or not?,0,0
1,445,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,446,whole conversation,that's fine.,0.4,0.4
1,447,whole conversation,because we used a greater than and start by zero. should be 023.,-0.4,0.4
1,448,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,449,whole conversation,"cool. and the results, we have to return.",0.6,0.6
1,450,whole conversation,we have to return the position that makes two side equal to each other.,-0.5,0.5
1,451,whole conversation,oh OK.,0.4,0.4
1,452,whole conversation,return a position.,-0.2,0.2
1,453,whole conversation,position is OK.,0.2,0.2
1,454,whole conversation,"some if true, we can we can return index.",-0.2,0.2
1,455,whole conversation,I think we have died from the game.,-0.6,0.6
1,456,whole conversation,"so we don't, we don't need to calculate.",-0.4,0.4
1,457,whole conversation,"we don't, we don't need.",-0.6,0.6
1,458,whole conversation,we need to divide by two.,-0.4,0.4
1,459,whole conversation,we first need to go to with the.,-0.1,0.1
1,460,whole conversation,"actually, I think it's OK. is OK.",0.3,0.3
1,461,whole conversation,to reach the maximum is the number of array divide one by two.,0,0
1,462,whole conversation,but we can stop before right I guess.,-0.1,0.1
1,463,whole conversation,and I’m not sure that in this programming language write like this or not.,-0.5,0.5
1,464,whole conversation,we can create something like boolean is equal to false and false.,-0.7,0.7
1,465,whole conversation,uh I think we can do something like this.,0,0
1,466,whole conversation,if is equal to.,0,0
1,467,whole conversation,yes. and set is equal to true.,0.5,0.5
1,468,whole conversation,and we need to break from the loop function.,-0.4,0.4
1,469,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,470,whole conversation,exactly.,0.6,0.6
1,471,whole conversation,what is the next one? for example what if like this 1 1 is equal.,0,0
1,472,whole conversation,and then 3 3 is equal.,0,0
1,473,whole conversation,but all 6 6  is also equal.,0,0
1,474,whole conversation,"but in our case, if do not calculate the one because it will say that OK.",-0.4,0.4
1,475,whole conversation,"it is fine, then it will break.",-0.4,0.4
1,476,whole conversation,"and we have to return the index, right?",-0.6,0.6
1,477,whole conversation,the index position.,-0.1,0.1
1,478,whole conversation,"So, we should define the index.",-0.3,0.3
1,479,whole conversation,no. should define i before going to the loop. and we can return.,-0.4,0.4
1,480,whole conversation,"no, sorry.",-0.8,0.8
1,481,whole conversation,my fault.,-0.9,0.9
1,482,whole conversation,we can also break.,0.1,0.1
1,483,whole conversation,I have one more idea.,0.2,0.2
1,484,whole conversation,I can run down.,-0.5,0.5
1,485,whole conversation,you can continue there.,0.4,0.4
1,486,whole conversation,"afterwards, check Umm.",-0.2,0.2
1,487,whole conversation,I think we can return here because it's already found and we can return i.,0.4,0.4
1,488,whole conversation,I but what.,-0.2,0.2
1,489,whole conversation,if but after the first iteration if you stop that station.,-0.3,0.3
1,490,whole conversation,you know what I mean?,0,0
1,491,whole conversation,"so, let's say that index is one and the i is one.",-0.1,0.1
1,492,whole conversation,"and then, we get the first element and the last element, right?",-0.2,0.2
1,493,whole conversation,"And then, some first will be one, some last will be one.",-0.1,0.1
1,494,whole conversation,"Then, if you check if equal then break or return index to stop.",-0.6,0.6
1,495,whole conversation,It will not go further this.,-0.7,0.7
1,496,whole conversation,It could be.,0,0
1,497,whole conversation,"So, we have to traverse and until the mid of the array, right?",-0.4,0.4
1,498,whole conversation,so then you're right.,-0.1,0.1
1,499,whole conversation,should be like this.,0.8,0.8
1,500,whole conversation,"No. in your case uh, we have to traverse until.",-0.4,0.4
1,501,whole conversation,"no actually uh, calculate like this works only when size is the same size.",-0.6,0.6
1,502,whole conversation,"But, what I mean is in our case uh if we have abcde  or the first we should to calculate a and b plus c plus d plus e. not.",-0.4,0.4
1,503,whole conversation,We go to the first to another group like a plus b and calculate c plus d plus e plus is the same one.,0.4,0.4
1,504,whole conversation,Not go further.,-0.6,0.6
1,505,whole conversation,"But, this loop does not have behavior like this.",-0.8,0.8
1,506,whole conversation,Do you get it?,0,0
1,507,whole conversation,"So, we have to first maybe maybe two loops.",-0.2,0.2
1,508,whole conversation,I think I have an idea again.,0.6,0.6
1,509,whole conversation,uh let's try.,0,0
1,510,whole conversation,Never mind.,0.1,0.1
1,511,whole conversation,That's OK.,0.3,0.3
1,512,whole conversation,"So, we can sum first equal to sum last.",0,0
1,513,whole conversation,Then is equal equal to true.,0,0
1,514,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,515,whole conversation,Then let me try.,-0.4,0.4
1,516,whole conversation,you know this.,0,0
1,517,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,518,whole conversation,and then it came here the next step.,0,0
1,519,whole conversation,else if sum fist is not equal sum last and is equal equal to true return i minus one.,-0.3,0.3
1,520,whole conversation,"If not equal, otherwise, continue.",-0.3,0.3
1,521,whole conversation,What about this one?,-0.3,0.3
1,522,whole conversation,One moment.,0.4,0.4
1,523,whole conversation,Let me try a calculation in a couple minutes.,0.1,0.1
1,524,whole conversation,Are you saying you have a problem? if we calculate like I mean some of the array.,-0.6,0.6
1,525,whole conversation,It means if we go from the left side and the right side at the same pace.,-0.1,0.1
1,526,whole conversation,Do you know what I mean?,0,0
1,527,whole conversation,"a b c d e. but what I understand is like if we start from the left side and calculate for the left side and every time, we calculate the left side calculate all right side or no we have the same.",-0.3,0.3
1,528,whole conversation,We are the same also dropdown.,0,0
1,529,whole conversation,this array length minus one is the last item.,-0.5,0.5
1,530,whole conversation,"So, in the first iteration, we get one from the first.",0,0
1,531,whole conversation,And then we get one from the last.,-0.2,0.2
1,532,whole conversation,And then we add the first one to here and the last one to here.,-0.1,0.1
1,533,whole conversation,and then compare it.,-0.4,0.4
1,534,whole conversation,if it is equal to the is equal to true and then in the next step.,0.1,0.1
1,535,whole conversation,for example.,0,0
1,536,whole conversation,"for example, it is now 2, and then it will continue at true here and add another one from the last second to here.",-0.1,0.1
1,537,whole conversation,both of them sum first sum it again 3 is equal.,0.1,0.1
1,538,whole conversation,"so it equal to true again, it can continues until it's exact equal.",0.1,0.1
1,539,whole conversation,"and if it is not equal, and then the previous value of this equal.",0,0
1,540,whole conversation,it’s also true so. that means the previous iteration was correct.,0.1,0.1
1,541,whole conversation,and there is another step after that.,-0.3,0.3
1,542,whole conversation,"So, then it should to return that index minus one.",-0.8,0.8
1,543,whole conversation,"I think, maybe we can just try check them out.",0,0
1,544,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,545,whole conversation,you we can try your solution first.,0,0
1,546,whole conversation,"yeah then if it doesn't work, then we can continue with yours.",0.1,0.1
1,547,whole conversation,ok.,0.7,0.7
1,548,whole conversation,let’s try.,0.2,0.2
1,549,whole conversation,here try let’s put the.,0,0
1,550,whole conversation,"we have the double index instead what we have trying, not it does it.",-0.3,0.3
1,551,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,552,whole conversation,I will try.,0.1,0.1
1,553,whole conversation,oh what's happened.,-0.4,0.4
1,554,whole conversation,huh return.,-0.6,0.6
1,555,whole conversation,"oh, you have to return everything and here you may be.",-0.5,0.5
1,556,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,557,whole conversation,"now, can you run?",-0.2,0.2
1,558,whole conversation,Yes.,0.4,0.4
1,559,whole conversation,I hope it will work.,0.1,0.1
1,560,whole conversation,hey.,0.2,0.2
1,561,whole conversation,what happened?,-0.4,0.4
1,562,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,563,whole conversation,come on.,-0.4,0.4
1,564,whole conversation,It said index out of range.,-0.5,0.5
1,565,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,566,whole conversation,now let's continue with yours.,0.3,0.3
1,567,whole conversation,get index range.,-0.1,0.1
1,568,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,569,whole conversation,let's see debug step by step.,0.1,0.1
1,570,whole conversation,and we got index 4 for go inside.,0,0
1,571,whole conversation,index four?,0,0
1,572,whole conversation,Ok.,0.6,0.6
1,573,whole conversation,four.,0.1,0.1
1,574,whole conversation,yes. and then they explore.,0,0
1,575,whole conversation,oh because of we use length.,0,0
1,576,whole conversation,oh should have because this thing is equal to 8 minus zero.,-0.2,0.2
1,577,whole conversation,why zero minus i.,-0.3,0.3
1,578,whole conversation,minus zero.,-0.7,0.7
1,579,whole conversation,where is the debugger right now.,-0.6,0.6
1,580,whole conversation,it's gone.,-0.7,0.7
1,581,whole conversation,I already.,-0.1,0.1
1,582,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,583,whole conversation,"let's see another one, here.",0,0
1,584,whole conversation,OK just go one step forward.,0,0
1,585,whole conversation,should be one then.,-0.4,0.4
1,586,whole conversation,"should be equal, should be minus one because the array starts from zero you know what I mean?",-0.7,0.7
1,587,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,588,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,589,whole conversation,yeah that's fine.,0.7,0.7
1,590,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,591,whole conversation,"just really, so it's true.",0.5,0.5
1,592,whole conversation,"but should not be true, can you run again.",-0.7,0.7
1,593,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
1,594,whole conversation,what thing you have changed.,-0.3,0.3
1,595,whole conversation,ah yes.,0.7,0.7
1,596,whole conversation,it should be enough i minus one.,-0.7,0.7
1,597,whole conversation,now it will.,-0.1,0.1
1,598,whole conversation,now I change it to 6.,0.1,0.1
1,599,whole conversation,now it should return 2.,-0.6,0.6
1,600,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,601,whole conversation,let’s change to second one.,0,0
1,602,whole conversation,it could be.,0,0
1,603,whole conversation,"should be zero, right?",-0.5,0.5
1,604,whole conversation,Your length should be.,-0.1,0.1
1,605,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
1,606,whole conversation,cool.,0.9,0.9
1,607,whole conversation,you're right.,0.4,0.4
1,608,whole conversation,wow we finished!,0.9,0.9
1,609,whole conversation,we couldn't finish the second one.,-0.6,0.6
1,610,whole conversation,I think it is okay.,0.4,0.4
1,611,whole conversation,we almost finished them.,0,0
2,1,experience,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,2,experience,I think you you just need to you know go through the presentation yeah you know slides.,0.3,0.3
2,3,experience,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,4,experience,"yeah, OK.",0.7,0.7
2,5,experience,great.,0.9,0.9
2,6,experience,so we are done with our setup right now we need to focus on the tasks.,-0.3,0.3
2,7,experience,so just comment says convert string to camelcase.,-0.2,0.2
2,8,experience,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,9,experience,"ohh, i sorry?",-0.5,0.5
2,10,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,11,experience,this will be one string that will be coming into our function.,0,0
2,12,experience,Oh.,0.2,0.2
2,13,experience,"yeah, yeah yeah, we are in the Visual Studio code.",0,0
2,14,experience,I'm supposed to see what you're writing and you were supposed to see what I'm writing.,-0.5,0.5
2,15,experience,waits.,-0.5,0.5
2,16,experience,can you see by the way my?,-0.1,0.1
2,17,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,18,experience,can you can you type something?,0,0
2,19,experience,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,20,experience,uh no.,-0.3,0.3
2,21,experience,I I I just saw your marker moved power.,0,0
2,22,experience,I think uh yeah yeah.,0.8,0.8
2,23,experience,it doesn't matter.,-0.2,0.2
2,24,experience,no problem.,0.6,0.6
2,25,experience,I am going to start.,0,0
2,26,experience,and as you can see me.,0,0
2,27,experience,I think there's no problem that.,0.4,0.4
2,28,experience,my first language was actually Java but I haven't practiced it since a long time.,0.1,0.1
2,29,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,30,experience,um it's a great language that.,0.4,0.4
2,31,experience,you started with sorry?,-0.5,0.5
2,32,experience,you started with C++?,-0.1,0.1
2,33,experience,"yeah, yeah, that's that's good too that's actually HTML CSS the JavaScript  those are the languages of Internet, right?",0,0
2,34,experience,"yeah, right.",0.2,0.2
2,35,experience,so this is basically the basic template to start a Java program.,-0.4,0.4
2,36,experience,we need to create a method that can take a string.,-0.3,0.3
2,37,experience,uh yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,38,experience,now I can see what you're typing.,0.7,0.7
2,39,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,40,experience,"no, just uh I just created a template string so that I can work with it in in the method that I'm going to write.",-0.2,0.2
2,41,experience,now we need to do is this is an array of strings as input.,-0.1,0.1
2,42,experience,I'm sorry.,-0.8,0.8
2,43,experience,I’m not understand.,-0.8,0.8
2,44,experience,"yeah, no problem.",0.6,0.6
2,45,experience,it's just I'm just thinking and.,0,0
2,46,experience,I can I'm not 100% sure if I'm doing it right.,-0.2,0.2
2,47,experience,"you you you help me,  what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to look through the string that I took uh one by one as in Java you know the string is already.",-0.6,0.6
2,48,experience,I think in most of the languages the string is already an array.,0.4,0.4
2,49,experience,so it is it is easy to iterate over over the array through a loop.,0.3,0.3
2,50,experience,so that's what I'm doing and I'm trying to find a delimiter which is the dash the underscore and and the dash underscore.,-0.2,0.2
2,51,experience,you're right.,0.4,0.4
2,52,experience,this this dash and underscore those are the delimiters.,0.2,0.2
2,53,experience,"Ok, two dash or.",0,0
2,54,experience,uh that's a dash and the next one is going to be underscore.,-0.2,0.2
2,55,experience,we need to have equals.,-0.2,0.2
2,56,experience,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,57,experience,So what I'm checking here is if I get an underscore or a dash within my string.,-0.2,0.2
2,58,experience,I am going to change something within this string.,-0.4,0.4
2,59,experience,so if I get a dash then the next letter will be changed to uppercase.,-0.1,0.1
2,60,experience,how to change to uppercase in Java?,-0.1,0.1
2,61,experience,I think we are going to lose so much time.,-0.7,0.7
2,62,experience,we have only 15 minutes for this task.,-0.2,0.2
2,63,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,64,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,65,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,66,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,67,experience,thank you.,0.8,0.8
2,68,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,69,experience,yeah sure.,0.4,0.4
2,70,experience,sorry?,-0.6,0.6
2,71,experience,"uh, I am not sure though.",0,0
2,72,experience,is it working?,-0.2,0.2
2,73,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,74,experience,"yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure.",0.6,0.6
2,75,experience,I think yeah that that that makes sense to certain extent but I am not that familiar with that array or string method.,-0.2,0.2
2,76,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,77,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,78,experience,I think we need to move to the next task.,-0.4,0.4
2,79,experience,I'm this is you you.,0,0
2,80,experience,"I think it will work, I'm not able to run it for whatever reason.",-0.5,0.5
2,81,experience,yeah it will stay save.,0.7,0.7
2,82,experience,I think I can just create another file this.,-0.5,0.5
2,83,experience,so yeah.  to keep multiplying and.,0,0
2,84,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,85,experience,go ahead save. to keep multiplying until we get a single digit number.,-0.1,0.1
2,86,experience,has 15 minutes and we need to write a function persistence.,-0.4,0.4
2,87,experience,"you know we don't need another another task tutor, so we can create within this.",0,0
2,88,experience,yeah yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,89,experience,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,90,experience,within the same class just outside of the main method.,0,0
2,91,experience,it is great to see return a number put the giant persistence repairs.,0.9,0.9
2,92,experience,Nope I'm trying to.,-0.7,0.7
2,93,experience,"in there every number, we can turn it into a string and string is an array then we can turn it back into numbers is there any easier way?",0,0
2,94,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,95,experience,I'm trying to you know convert the text number the receive number.,-0.3,0.3
2,96,experience,we received into the function through a text.,-0.1,0.1
2,97,experience,"so, then we then we can loop over every single digit or what we could have done is we could have you know module used the modulus to separate out the digits, but that is a different way.",-0.5,0.5
2,98,experience,we can try.,0,0
2,99,experience,"if I go zero, then the first and the second string will get.",-0.4,0.4
2,100,experience,uh it doesn't make sense too.,-0.9,0.9
2,101,experience,"I don't think it makes sense because when the the i will be 0, the number the first is it and the second is it will get multiplied.",-0.8,0.8
2,102,experience,"but when the i will be one, then the 2nd and the 3rd digit will be multiplied.",-0.4,0.4
2,103,experience,"oh, this is this is no problem because this is a local variable.",0,0
2,104,experience,this will only work if we give it the only two two digit numbers.,-0.6,0.6
2,105,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,106,experience,to use Google actually.,-0.4,0.4
2,107,experience,uh did you send anything?,-0.2,0.2
2,108,experience,but the first the first part makes sense.,0.1,0.1
2,109,experience,it is singling out the digits uh static and dig some.,0,0
2,110,experience,no problem.,0.6,0.6
2,111,experience,to test that oh wow that's really simple.,0.7,0.7
2,112,experience,interesting.,0.8,0.8
2,113,experience,I am going to comment out this code and.,-0.2,0.2
2,114,experience,yeah and really it is it is understandable.,0.5,0.5
2,115,experience,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,116,experience,hopefully.,0.4,0.4
2,117,experience,I'm asking to leave this one.,-0.8,0.8
2,118,experience,"yeah, I'm just going to take it out of the main function.",-0.4,0.4

2,144,experience,no.,-0.5,0.5
2,145,experience,I don't think because of of the second.,-0.6,0.6
2,146,experience,uh problem we wrote.,-0.7,0.7
2,147,experience,"I think it's because of the first one, but the one that we did.",0.2,0.2
2,148,experience,"and we I we were confident that this kind of work, camel cases.",-0.1,0.1

2,154,experience,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,155,experience,so I think I don't see any problem.,0.4,0.4
2,156,experience,so the third task is equal sides of an array.,0.1,0.1
2,157,experience,No problem.,0.6,0.6
2,158,experience,task time for second one is over.,-0.5,0.5
2,159,experience,"So, move to the next third task.",-0.1,0.1
2,160,experience,yet Nope and.,0.1,0.1
2,161,experience,yeah I think it is one of those sorting problems.,-0.2,0.2
2,162,experience,sure.,0.4,0.4
2,163,experience,"so, we have been given an array debt the number the left digits and the right digits should be equal to the same number.",-0.1,0.1
2,164,experience,it something like that.,-0.1,0.1
2,165,experience,"How we can look over the array from the forward side and the backward side? and that's from iterative program, we can.",-0.1,0.1
2,166,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,167,experience,I'm just thinking how can we approach this problem.,-0.7,0.7
2,168,experience,yeah.  and all those found an answer for this problem.,-0.3,0.3
2,169,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,170,experience,"on online, on GitHub.",0,0
2,171,experience,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,172,experience,How is it working?,-0.3,0.3
2,173,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,174,experience,"I'm I'm trying to, you know internalize this?",-0.4,0.4
2,175,experience,how is this working?,-0.3,0.3
2,176,experience,I can provide you the answer and you can also take a look at it and see how is it working.,0.1,0.1
2,177,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,178,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,179,experience,The problem here is the code is written in JavaScript and we need to have it in Java.,-0.6,0.6
2,180,experience,right.,0.3,0.3
2,181,experience,I can convert.,0.2,0.2
2,182,experience,but I'm not sure that array dot slice and array dot reduce methods exist in Java.  in Java as well.,-0.3,0.3
2,183,experience,I've got another solution in Java.,-0.3,0.3
2,184,experience,but I don't understand this either.,-0.7,0.7
2,185,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,186,experience,"array copy that’s something a built-in function, I think.",0,0
2,187,experience,"array copy, what’s array copy.",-0.1,0.1
2,188,experience,"It’s a special position, scope.",0,0
2,189,experience,"destination position, and round for.",0.4,0.4
2,190,experience,"yeah. he somehow managed to understand the problem that, uh, you know the solution that we found.",0.7,0.7
2,191,experience,so basically array copy is a built-in function and it takes the and you know source array the destination and the array the new array that it is going to produce and the destination all those sort of things.,0.3,0.3
2,192,experience,so and and they're approaching it just like I was telling you that they're approaching it from the one side forward side of the array and the backward side of the area and they're trying to match you know those those elements and see when the sum of those elements are equal to one another.,-0.6,0.6
2,193,experience,that's when they generate the results I think.,-0.3,0.3
2,194,experience,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,195,experience,I'm sorry?,-0.5,0.5
2,196,experience,uh yeah maybe three or 4 minutes.,-0.1,0.1

2,22,receiver,I can see what you type.,0.1,0.1
2,23,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,24,receiver,my first language was actually Java but I haven't practiced it since a long time.,0.1,0.1
2,25,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,26,receiver,um it's a great language that.,0.4,0.4

2,37,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,38,receiver,"no, just uh I just created a template string so that I can work with it in in the method that I'm going to write.",-0.2,0.2
2,39,receiver,I'm sorry.,-0.8,0.8
2,40,receiver,I’m not understand.,-0.8,0.8
2,41,receiver,"yeah, no problem.",0.6,0.6

2,48,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,49,receiver,uh that's a dash and the next one is going to be underscore.,-0.2,0.2
2,50,receiver,we need to have equals.,-0.2,0.2
2,51,receiver,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,52,receiver,So what I'm checking here is if I get an underscore or a dash within my string.,-0.2,0.2
2,53,receiver,I am going to change something within this string.,-0.4,0.4
2,54,receiver,oh.,0.2,0.2
2,55,receiver,"at least, I can help to check Google I think that's allowed.",0.1,0.1

2,65,receiver,"yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure.",0.6,0.6
2,66,receiver,I think yeah that that that makes sense to certain extent but I am not that familiar with that array or string method.,-0.2,0.2
2,67,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,68,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,69,receiver,I think we need to move to the next task.,-0.4,0.4
2,70,receiver,I'm this is you you.,0,0
2,71,receiver,"I think it will work, I'm not able to run it for whatever reason.",-0.5,0.5
2,72,receiver,yeah it will stay save.,0.7,0.7
2,73,receiver,I think I can just create another file this.,-0.5,0.5
2,74,receiver,so yeah.  to keep multiplying and.,0,0
2,75,receiver,"yeah, that's that's scope for it.",0,0
2,76,receiver,you feel we should greet within task one.,0.4,0.4
2,77,receiver,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,78,receiver,within the same class just outside of the main method.,0,0
2,79,receiver,you've been able to come up with anything.,0.6,0.6
2,80,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,81,receiver,I'm also trying to check online and see but getting.,-0.4,0.4
2,82,receiver,and your favorite things.,0.8,0.8
2,83,receiver,oh I was looking at text too.,0,0
2,84,receiver,I haven't.,-0.3,0.3
2,85,receiver,you already got something on text 1.,0,0
2,86,receiver,oh I sorry.,-0.7,0.7

2,103,receiver,but the first the first part makes sense.,0.1,0.1
2,104,receiver,it is singling out the digits uh static and dig some.,0,0
2,105,receiver,no problem.,0.6,0.6
2,106,receiver,to test that oh wow that's really simple.,0.7,0.7
2,107,receiver,interesting.,0.8,0.8

2,112,receiver,it's cool. that's cool.,0.9,0.9
2,113,receiver,"it’s just that we can we can go on are and see how responsive it is or if there are any errors, but I think there shouldn't be any error.",0,0
2,114,receiver,I think they need more function that you committed.,-0.6,0.6
2,115,receiver,I will just advance.,0,0
2,116,receiver,So.,0,0
2,117,receiver,alright.,0.4,0.4

2,124,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,125,receiver,one try.,0.3,0.3
2,126,receiver,you want to try using an online compiler to run it and see?,-0.2,0.2
2,127,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,128,receiver,"if we have time, you can just try that.",0,0
2,129,receiver,we just try that.,0,0
2,130,receiver,let's see how are responsive that will be learn everyday yeah.,0.3,0.3
2,131,receiver,compilation error?,-0.6,0.6
2,132,receiver,didn't just think that's because we're having two different task being from the same time.,-0.1,0.1
2,133,receiver,just  is it showing any red lines to tell us where the error might be.,-0.3,0.3
2,134,receiver,would you just add the rest of the code the one I sent to the charts and see if.,0,0
2,135,receiver,ah I can't see yet.,-0.7,0.7
2,136,receiver,I am scrolling through.,-0.2,0.2
2,137,receiver,is it in this isn't the zoom chat or right here in VSCode?,-0.2,0.2
2,138,receiver,"oh, so sorry, I can’t still see.",-0.8,0.8
2,139,receiver,"But, no problem.",0.1,0.1

2,145,receiver,What do you feel?,-0.1,0.1
2,146,receiver,are you are you with me?,-0.1,0.1
2,147,receiver,still not working?,-0.8,0.8
2,148,receiver,let's let's just try and modify the one you wrote and see if.,-0.1,0.1
2,149,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,150,receiver,understood.,0,0
2,151,receiver,we have the error from the first one. is that what you're trying to say.,-0.7,0.7
2,152,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,153,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,154,receiver,I see.,0,0
2,155,receiver,this time this is good training.,0.8,0.8

2,158,receiver,it's going cool!,0.9,0.9
2,159,receiver,it's going cool!,0.9,0.9
2,160,receiver,"it's little stress, no no work hustle and bustle.",0,0
2,161,receiver,"So, it’s really do it yet.",0.1,0.1
2,162,receiver,I was disconnected for a few seconds.,-0.7,0.7
2,163,receiver,very sorry about that.,-0.8,0.8
2,164,receiver,I think.,0,0
2,165,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,166,receiver,"so, it sounds a bit tougher.",0,0
2,167,receiver,We have 25 minutes for this any idea.,-0.3,0.3
2,168,receiver,so it's gonna be really tough.,-0.6,0.6
2,169,receiver,just one minute.,0.2,0.2
2,170,receiver,as I get to my airpods.,0,0
2,171,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,172,receiver,let us trying to figure out any idea or maybe get some.,-0.1,0.1
2,173,receiver,let's try really understand question and check.,-0.3,0.3
2,174,receiver,And yeah just trying to start through some things too.,0,0
2,175,receiver,I'm thinking too.,0.2,0.2
2,176,receiver,but now alright dictate this to something challenging.,0,0
2,177,receiver,it's good.,0.8,0.8
2,178,receiver,it's good timing.,0.7,0.7
2,179,receiver,you found an answer?,0,0
2,180,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,181,receiver,Cool! that's good.,0.9,0.9
2,182,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,183,receiver,"I'm I'm trying to, you know internalize this?",-0.4,0.4
2,184,receiver,how is this working?,-0.3,0.3
2,185,receiver,I can provide you the answer and you can also take a look at it and see how is it working.,0.1,0.1
2,186,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,187,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,188,receiver,"oh in Javascript, not in Java.",-0.5,0.5
2,189,receiver,What’s an idea?,-0.1,0.1
2,190,receiver,there's a lot.,0.6,0.6
2,191,receiver,"the array dot slice, dot reduce that would use think that's really really the major look clear one.",0.3,0.3
2,192,receiver,"if you could just check your the base, I could just really without convert.",-0.4,0.4
2,193,receiver,"if we are going convert then it’s going to be, it’s hard.",-0.6,0.6
2,194,receiver,this was possible.,0,0
2,195,receiver,How have you got?,0,0
2,196,receiver,Java?,0,0
2,197,receiver,you don't understand it it's looking advanced?,-0.6,0.6
2,198,receiver,it’s sorting already.,-0.2,0.2
2,199,receiver,"yeah. he somehow managed to understand the problem that, uh, you know the solution that we found.",0.7,0.7
2,200,receiver,so basically array copy is a built-in function and it takes the and you know source array the destination and the array the new array that it is going to produce and the destination all those sort of things.,0.3,0.3
2,201,receiver,so and and they're approaching it just like I was telling you that they're approaching it from the one side forward side of the array and the backward side of the area and they're trying to match you know those those elements and see when the sum of those elements are equal to one another.,-0.6,0.6
2,202,receiver,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,203,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,204,receiver,I'm sorry?,-0.5,0.5
2,205,receiver,uh yeah maybe three or 4 minutes.,-0.1,0.1
2,206,receiver,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,207,receiver,Sure.,0.2,0.2
2,208,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,209,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,210,receiver,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,211,receiver,I'm really upset.,-0.9,0.9
2,212,receiver,let's change it into an array.,-0.1,0.1
2,1,sender,Sorry.,-0.7,0.7
2,2,sender,I didn't get the last statement that was said.,-0.7,0.7
2,3,sender,can you please.,-0.1,0.1
2,4,sender,so so in the presentation the link we got uh the host was saying that we can actually install a extension of Visual Studio Code which allows us to share our codes with our friends or partners so the name of the extension is live share I've already downloaded it in my Google.,-0.2,0.2
2,5,sender,uh you know Visual Studio code.,0,0
2,6,sender,I think you you just need to you know go through the presentation yeah you know slides.,0.3,0.3
2,7,sender,B. and and you get a basic understanding of how we are going to do this.,-0.1,0.1
2,8,sender,just a few minutes.,0.3,0.3
2,9,sender,I'm also going through the presentation right now.,0.1,0.1
2,10,sender,can you can you see me yet.,-0.3,0.3
2,11,sender,just one second while trying.,-0.1,0.1
2,12,sender,so we are done with our setup right now we need to focus on the tasks.,-0.3,0.3
2,13,sender,so just comment says convert string to camelcase.,-0.2,0.2
2,14,sender,hey.,0.2,0.2
2,15,sender,let's do that.,0,0
2,16,sender,complete the method or function so that it converts dash or underscore deliminated words to come some first word within that should be capitalized only personal word scandalized known as upcoming case first word within the output we get with the works only if the original next skip.,-0.3,0.3
2,17,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,18,sender,and we approached this.,-0.1,0.1
2,19,sender,"ohh, i sorry?",-0.5,0.5
2,20,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,21,sender,this will be one string that will be coming into our function.,0,0
2,22,sender,Oh.,0.2,0.2
2,23,sender,"yeah, yeah yeah, we are in the Visual Studio code.",0,0
2,24,sender,I'm supposed to see what you're writing and you were supposed to see what I'm writing.,-0.5,0.5
2,25,sender,waits.,-0.5,0.5
2,26,sender,can you see by the way my?,-0.1,0.1
2,27,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,28,sender,can you can you type something?,0,0
2,29,sender,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,30,sender,uh no.,-0.3,0.3
2,31,sender,I I I just saw your marker moved power.,0,0
2,32,sender,I think uh yeah yeah.,0.8,0.8
2,33,sender,it doesn't matter.,-0.2,0.2
2,34,sender,no problem.,0.6,0.6
2,35,sender,I am going to start.,0,0
2,36,sender,and as you can see me.,0,0
2,37,sender,I think there's no problem that.,0.4,0.4
2,38,sender,"oh, you must be very good at Java.",0.8,0.8
2,39,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,40,sender,That sounds understandable.,0.6,0.6
2,41,sender,I think I'm just really really getting to understand you.,0.4,0.4
2,42,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,43,sender,but I I had it to be a bit hard a bit tough.,-0.1,0.1
2,44,sender,What do you think ?,-0.1,0.1
2,45,sender,you started with sorry?,-0.5,0.5
2,46,sender,you started with C++?,-0.1,0.1
2,47,sender,"yeah, yeah, that's that's good too that's actually HTML CSS the JavaScript  those are the languages of Internet, right?",0,0
2,48,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,49,sender,"I see what you got here, public static, void, main, string, Args.",-0.4,0.4
2,50,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,51,sender,great.,0.9,0.9
2,52,sender,we need to create a method that can take a string.,-0.3,0.3
2,53,sender,"I think it just so what I type on, and delete it.",-0.7,0.7
2,54,sender,it just.,0,0
2,55,sender,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,56,sender,oh beautiful.,0.9,0.9
2,57,sender,so I just creating a string for the first task.,0,0
2,58,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,59,sender,you go on.,0,0
2,60,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,61,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,62,sender,it's getting clear.,0,0
2,63,sender,oh.,0.2,0.2
2,64,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,65,sender,now we need to do is this is an array of strings as input.,-0.1,0.1
2,66,sender,"How can I get in pieces, one way most of the work?",-0.2,0.2
2,67,sender,That operation is not the piece that you are doing most of the work.,-0.7,0.7
2,68,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,69,sender,I can I'm not 100% sure if I'm doing it right.,-0.2,0.2
2,70,sender,"you you you help me,  what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to look through the string that I took uh one by one as in Java you know the string is already.",-0.6,0.6
2,71,sender,I think in most of the languages the string is already an array.,0.4,0.4
2,72,sender,so it is it is easy to iterate over over the array through a loop.,0.3,0.3
2,73,sender,so that's what I'm doing and I'm trying to find a delimiter which is the dash the underscore and and the dash underscore.,-0.2,0.2
2,74,sender,you're right.,0.4,0.4
2,75,sender,this this dash and underscore those are the delimiters.,0.2,0.2
2,76,sender,"Ok, two dash or.",0,0
2,77,sender,do you intend putting underscore here or dash with that?,-0.2,0.2
2,78,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,79,sender,great.,0.9,0.9
2,80,sender,so if I get a dash then the next letter will be changed to uppercase.,-0.1,0.1
2,81,sender,how to change to uppercase in Java?,-0.1,0.1
2,82,sender,I think we are going to lose so much time.,-0.7,0.7
2,83,sender,we have only 15 minutes for this task.,-0.2,0.2
2,84,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,85,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,86,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,87,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,88,sender,thank you.,0.8,0.8
2,89,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,90,sender,yeah sure.,0.4,0.4
2,91,sender,I think I'm not I'm not allowed to paste.,-0.8,0.8
2,92,sender,I'm just pasting on the chats.,-0.1,0.1
2,93,sender,"I'm not sure, so.",-0.1,0.1
2,94,sender,it is from a trusted site which is just use that as a subsidiary like.,-0.1,0.1
2,95,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,96,sender,I understand yeah they all is different type.,-0.2,0.2
2,97,sender,"you good on this, right ?  is a way you save that or you probably?",0.3,0.3
2,98,sender,yeah you too.,0.6,0.6
2,99,sender,you are literally helpful.,0.9,0.9
2,100,sender,you're really really helpful.,0.9,0.9
2,101,sender,"if it were left to me, I would really be confused.",-0.7,0.7
2,102,sender,this is task two is saying.,-0.1,0.1
2,103,sender,Assistance Bugger.,0.1,0.1
2,104,sender,"A type of function persistence that takes in a positive parameter known and returns its multiplicative assistance which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in number until you reach a single digit, for example, inputs is greater than output has nine is greater than three because 3 * 9 = 27, 2 *7 = 14, 1 * 4 questions for 14K only one you have.",0,0
2,105,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,106,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,107,sender,go ahead save. to keep multiplying until we get a single digit number.,-0.1,0.1
2,108,sender,has 15 minutes and we need to write a function persistence.,-0.4,0.4
2,109,sender,"you know we don't need another another task tutor, so we can create within this.",0,0
2,110,sender,yeah yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,111,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,112,sender,"Now, the least is task 2.",-0.2,0.2
2,113,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,114,sender,great.,0.9,0.9
2,115,sender,it is great to see return a number put the giant persistence repairs.,0.9,0.9
2,116,sender,Nope I'm trying to.,-0.7,0.7
2,117,sender,"in there every number, we can turn it into a string and string is an array then we can turn it back into numbers is there any easier way?",0,0
2,118,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,119,sender,I'm trying to you know convert the text number the receive number.,-0.3,0.3
2,120,sender,we received into the function through a text.,-0.1,0.1
2,121,sender,"so, then we then we can loop over every single digit or what we could have done is we could have you know module used the modulus to separate out the digits, but that is a different way.",-0.5,0.5
2,122,sender,we can try.,0,0
2,123,sender,"if I go zero, then the first and the second string will get.",-0.4,0.4
2,124,sender,uh it doesn't make sense too.,-0.9,0.9
2,125,sender,"I don't think it makes sense because when the the i will be 0, the number the first is it and the second is it will get multiplied.",-0.8,0.8
2,126,sender,"but when the i will be one, then the 2nd and the 3rd digit will be multiplied.",-0.4,0.4
2,127,sender,"oh, this is this is no problem because this is a local variable.",0,0
2,128,sender,this will only work if we give it the only two two digit numbers.,-0.6,0.6
2,129,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,130,sender,to use Google actually.,-0.4,0.4
2,131,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,132,sender,"so, what I sent that.",-0.3,0.3
2,133,sender,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,134,sender,Sorry.,-0.7,0.7
2,135,sender,I sent something yeah on the google not really trusted.,-0.7,0.7
2,136,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,137,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,138,sender,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,139,sender,I am going to comment out this code and.,-0.2,0.2
2,140,sender,sometimes you write a code takes so long and when you just see someone professional writing it very short and simple and.,-0.6,0.6
2,141,sender,driver runs.,-0.3,0.3
2,142,sender,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,143,sender,hopefully.,0.4,0.4
2,144,sender,I'm asking to leave this one.,-0.8,0.8
2,145,sender,"yeah, I'm just going to take it out of the main function.",-0.4,0.4
2,146,sender,so that it doesn't run every time.,-0.3,0.3
2,147,sender,I run the main function.,0,0
2,148,sender,this I just sent you the rest of the code it wasn't complete.,-0.7,0.7
2,149,sender,"I, you know, there is a way we can check actually this one, but we need to go to an online compiler.",-0.4,0.4
2,150,sender,and yeah.,0.3,0.3
2,151,sender,yeah. that that thing.,-0.2,0.2
2,152,sender,it is giving us a compilation error.,-0.8,0.8
2,153,sender,"uh, no. it's actually a single class.",-0.6,0.6
2,154,sender,"and I don't think it should be a problem, but it is saying that a parenthesis.",-0.5,0.5
2,155,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,156,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,157,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,158,sender,"yeah, I think I. yeah I've added it to the uh solution already you can see in the main section.",0,0
2,159,sender,the one you wrote it is I'm I've highlighted the section.,0,0
2,160,sender,can you see it ?,0,0
2,161,sender,"um, it's I've highlighted it.",0.1,0.1
2,162,sender,can you see it now?,-0.1,0.1
2,163,sender,in VSCode.,0,0
2,164,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,165,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,166,sender,"i am trying to run this program, but it is not working.",-0.8,0.8
2,167,sender,nope.,-0.8,0.8
2,168,sender,no.,-0.5,0.5
2,169,sender,I don't think because of of the second.,-0.6,0.6
2,170,sender,uh problem we wrote.,-0.7,0.7
2,171,sender,"I think it's because of the first one, but the one that we did.",0.2,0.2
2,172,sender,"and we I we were confident that this kind of work, camel cases.",-0.1,0.1
2,173,sender,"yeah, right.",0.2,0.2
2,174,sender,right.,0.3,0.3
2,175,sender,"Sorry, I just been having terrible cough.",-0.8,0.8
2,176,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,177,sender,"how was your new year, by the way?",0,0
2,178,sender,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,179,sender,so I think I don't see any problem.,0.4,0.4
2,180,sender,so the third task is equal sides of an array.,0.1,0.1
2,181,sender,No problem.,0.6,0.6
2,182,sender,task time for second one is over.,-0.5,0.5
2,183,sender,"So, move to the next third task.",-0.1,0.1
2,184,sender,yet Nope and.,0.1,0.1
2,185,sender,yeah I think it is one of those sorting problems.,-0.2,0.2
2,186,sender,sure.,0.4,0.4
2,187,sender,"so, we have been given an array debt the number the left digits and the right digits should be equal to the same number.",-0.1,0.1
2,188,sender,it something like that.,-0.1,0.1
2,189,sender,"How we can look over the array from the forward side and the backward side? and that's from iterative program, we can.",-0.1,0.1
2,190,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,191,sender,I'm just thinking how can we approach this problem.,-0.7,0.7
2,192,sender,yeah.  and all those found an answer for this problem.,-0.3,0.3
2,193,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,194,sender,"on online, on GitHub.",0,0
2,195,sender,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,196,sender,How is it working?,-0.3,0.3
2,197,sender,Are you trying to compile this one?,-0.2,0.2
2,198,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,199,sender,good.,0.8,0.8
2,200,sender,can you send on chat?,0,0
2,201,sender,I'm still trying to understand.,-0.4,0.4
2,202,sender,Understand and analyze it.,-0.1,0.1
2,203,sender,The problem here is the code is written in JavaScript and we need to have it in Java.,-0.6,0.6
2,204,sender,right.,0.3,0.3
2,205,sender,I can convert.,0.2,0.2
2,206,sender,but I'm not sure that array dot slice and array dot reduce methods exist in Java.  in Java as well.,-0.3,0.3
2,207,sender,I've got another solution in Java.,-0.3,0.3
2,208,sender,but I don't understand this either.,-0.7,0.7
2,209,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,210,sender,"array copy that’s something a built-in function, I think.",0,0
2,211,sender,"array copy, what’s array copy.",-0.1,0.1
2,212,sender,"It’s a special position, scope.",0,0
2,213,sender,"destination position, and round for.",0.4,0.4
2,214,sender,I will pull this source of works.,-0.1,0.1
2,215,sender,so we're going to be.,0,0
2,216,sender,very slow.,-0.8,0.8
2,217,sender,did you to come up with something?,-0.1,0.1
2,218,sender,that's when they generate the results I think.,-0.3,0.3
2,219,sender,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,220,sender,"we still have time, right?",-0.1,0.1
2,221,sender,so we still have time?,-0.1,0.1
2,222,sender,I'm trying to join the live share  working for Google.,-0.1,0.1
2,223,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,224,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,225,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,226,sender,so you're saying that must have a lot of written functions.,-0.2,0.2
2,227,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,228,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,229,sender,You got it.,0.3,0.3
2,230,sender,at least one or two should work out of the three.,-0.1,0.1
2,231,sender,it's not bad for you.,0.4,0.4
2,232,sender,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,233,sender,this week we could get feedback on which one works or which one doesn't work.,-0.6,0.6
2,234,sender,just to me put on just one people you need to.,0,0
2,235,sender,We actually almost done.,0,0
2,1,whole conversation,Sorry.,-0.7,0.7
2,2,whole conversation,I didn't get the last statement that was said.,-0.7,0.7
2,3,whole conversation,can you please.,-0.1,0.1
2,4,whole conversation,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,5,whole conversation,so so in the presentation the link we got uh the host was saying that we can actually install a extension of Visual Studio Code which allows us to share our codes with our friends or partners so the name of the extension is live share I've already downloaded it in my Google.,-0.2,0.2
2,6,whole conversation,uh you know Visual Studio code.,0,0
2,7,whole conversation,again quick so.,0.3,0.3
2,8,whole conversation,I think you you just need to you know go through the presentation yeah you know slides.,0.3,0.3
2,9,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,10,whole conversation,B. and and you get a basic understanding of how we are going to do this.,-0.1,0.1
2,11,whole conversation,"OK, just a few minutes.",0,0
2,12,whole conversation,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,13,whole conversation,I'm also going through the presentation right now.,0.1,0.1
2,14,whole conversation,Yes.,0.4,0.4

2,18,whole conversation,just one second while trying.,-0.1,0.1
2,19,whole conversation,"Oh, Yeah.",0.8,0.8
2,20,whole conversation,so we are done with our setup right now we need to focus on the tasks.,-0.3,0.3
2,21,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,22,whole conversation,so just comment says convert string to camelcase.,-0.2,0.2
2,23,whole conversation,hey.,0.2,0.2
2,24,whole conversation,let's do that.,0,0
2,25,whole conversation,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,26,whole conversation,complete the method or function so that it converts dash or underscore deliminated words to come some first word within that should be capitalized only personal word scandalized known as upcoming case first word within the output we get with the works only if the original next skip.,-0.3,0.3
2,27,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,28,whole conversation,and we approached this.,-0.1,0.1
2,29,whole conversation,"Yes, of course.",0.2,0.2
2,30,whole conversation,"ohh, i sorry?",-0.5,0.5
2,31,whole conversation,no. not you not.,-0.2,0.2
2,32,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,33,whole conversation,this will be one string that will be coming into our function.,0,0
2,34,whole conversation,am I supposed to see what you are doing?,-0.3,0.3
2,35,whole conversation,I am supposed to see what I'm doing over.,-0.4,0.4
2,36,whole conversation,Oh.,0.2,0.2
2,37,whole conversation,"yeah, yeah yeah, we are in the Visual Studio code.",0,0
2,38,whole conversation,I'm supposed to see what you're writing and you were supposed to see what I'm writing.,-0.5,0.5
2,39,whole conversation,waits.,-0.5,0.5
2,40,whole conversation,can you see by the way my?,-0.1,0.1
2,41,whole conversation,Yes.,0.4,0.4
2,42,whole conversation,I'm seeing that what you are typing.,0,0
2,43,whole conversation,"yeah, I'm seeing what you're typing.",0,0
2,44,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,45,whole conversation,can you can you type something?,0,0
2,46,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,47,whole conversation,just a minute.,0.3,0.3
2,48,whole conversation,yeah. sure.,0,0
2,49,whole conversation,Did you see what I typed?,-0.1,0.1
2,50,whole conversation,uh no.,-0.3,0.3
2,51,whole conversation,I I I just saw your marker moved power.,0,0
2,52,whole conversation,I think uh yeah yeah.,0.8,0.8
2,53,whole conversation,it doesn't matter.,-0.2,0.2
2,54,whole conversation,no problem.,0.6,0.6
2,55,whole conversation,I am going to start.,0,0
2,56,whole conversation,and as you can see me.,0,0
2,57,whole conversation,I think there's no problem that.,0.4,0.4
2,58,whole conversation,I can see what you type.,0.1,0.1
2,59,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,60,whole conversation,"oh, you must be very good at Java.",0.8,0.8
2,61,whole conversation,my first language was actually Java but I haven't practiced it since a long time.,0.1,0.1
2,62,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,63,whole conversation,That sounds understandable.,0.6,0.6
2,64,whole conversation,I think I'm just really really getting to understand you.,0.4,0.4
2,65,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,66,whole conversation,um it's a great language that.,0.4,0.4
2,67,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,68,whole conversation,but I I had it to be a bit hard a bit tough.,-0.1,0.1
2,69,whole conversation,What do you think ?,-0.1,0.1
2,70,whole conversation,you started with sorry?,-0.5,0.5
2,71,whole conversation,you started with C++?,-0.1,0.1
2,72,whole conversation,"no, I did not I did not.",-0.6,0.6
2,73,whole conversation,"start I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript .",0,0
2,74,whole conversation,"yeah, yeah, that's that's good too that's actually HTML CSS the JavaScript  yeah.",0.8,0.8
2,75,whole conversation,"those are the languages of Internet, right?",-0.1,0.1
2,76,whole conversation,"yeah, yeah.",0.8,0.8
2,77,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,78,whole conversation,"I see what you got here, public static, void, main, string, Args.",-0.4,0.4
2,79,whole conversation,"yeah, right.",0.2,0.2
2,80,whole conversation,so this is basically the basic template to start a Java program.,-0.4,0.4
2,81,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,82,whole conversation,great.,0.9,0.9
2,83,whole conversation,we need to create a method that can take a string.,-0.3,0.3
2,84,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,85,whole conversation,training we're here for the time being.,0.3,0.3
2,86,whole conversation,"I think it just so what I type on, and delete it.",-0.7,0.7
2,87,whole conversation,uh yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,88,whole conversation,now I can see what you're typing.,0.7,0.7
2,89,whole conversation,it just.,0,0
2,90,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,91,whole conversation,oh beautiful.,0.9,0.9
2,92,whole conversation,so I just creating a string for the first task.,0,0
2,93,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,94,whole conversation,"no, just uh I just created a template string so that I can work with it in in the method that I'm going to write.",-0.2,0.2
2,95,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,96,whole conversation,you go on.,0,0
2,97,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,98,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,99,whole conversation,it's getting clear.,0,0
2,100,whole conversation,oh.,0.2,0.2
2,101,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,102,whole conversation,now we need to do is this is an array of strings as input.,-0.1,0.1
2,103,whole conversation,"How can I get in pieces, one way most of the work?",-0.2,0.2
2,104,whole conversation,I'm sorry.,-0.8,0.8
2,105,whole conversation,I’m not understand.,-0.8,0.8
2,106,whole conversation,That operation is not the piece that you are doing most of the work.,-0.7,0.7
2,107,whole conversation,"yeah, no problem.",0.6,0.6
2,108,whole conversation,it's just I'm just thinking and.,0,0
2,109,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,110,whole conversation,I can I'm not 100% sure if I'm doing it right.,-0.2,0.2
2,111,whole conversation,"you you you help me,  yeah, sure.",0.4,0.4
2,112,whole conversation,sure.,0.4,0.4
2,113,whole conversation,what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to look through the string that I took uh one by one as in Java you know the string is already.,-0.6,0.6
2,114,whole conversation,I think in most of the languages the string is already an array.,0.4,0.4
2,115,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,116,whole conversation,so it is it is easy to iterate over over the array through a loop.,0.3,0.3
2,117,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,118,whole conversation,so that's what I'm doing and I'm trying to find a delimiter which is the dash the underscore and and the dash underscore.,-0.2,0.2
2,119,whole conversation,You are trying to finding underscore on your keyword.,-0.3,0.3
2,120,whole conversation,you're right.,0.4,0.4
2,121,whole conversation,this this dash and underscore those are the delimiters.,0.2,0.2
2,122,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,123,whole conversation,"Ok, two dash or.",0,0
2,124,whole conversation,do you intend putting underscore here or dash with that?,-0.2,0.2
2,125,whole conversation,uh that's a dash and the next one is going to be underscore.,-0.2,0.2
2,126,whole conversation,we need to have equals.,-0.2,0.2
2,127,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,128,whole conversation,So what I'm checking here is if I get an underscore or a dash within my string.,-0.2,0.2
2,129,whole conversation,I am going to change something within this string.,-0.4,0.4
2,130,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,131,whole conversation,great.,0.9,0.9
2,132,whole conversation,so if I get a dash then the next letter will be changed to uppercase.,-0.1,0.1
2,133,whole conversation,how to change to uppercase in Java?,-0.1,0.1
2,134,whole conversation,I think we are going to lose so much time.,-0.7,0.7
2,135,whole conversation,we have only 15 minutes for this task.,-0.2,0.2
2,136,whole conversation,oh.,0.2,0.2
2,137,whole conversation,"at least, I can help to check Google I think that's allowed.",0.1,0.1
2,138,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,139,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,140,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,141,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,142,whole conversation,Good.,0.8,0.8
2,143,whole conversation,keep going while I am checking .,-0.3,0.3
2,144,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,145,whole conversation,thank you.,0.8,0.8
2,146,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,147,whole conversation,"I would just be swipe, but it's looking a bit advanced.",0.1,0.1
2,148,whole conversation,yeah sure.,0.4,0.4
2,149,whole conversation,"oh, I'm so much work guys.",0.5,0.5
2,150,whole conversation,I think I'm not I'm not allowed to paste.,-0.8,0.8
2,151,whole conversation,sorry?,-0.6,0.6
2,152,whole conversation,I'm just pasting on the chats.,-0.1,0.1
2,153,whole conversation,"uh, I am not sure though.",0,0
2,154,whole conversation,is it working?,-0.2,0.2
2,155,whole conversation,"I'm not sure, so.",-0.1,0.1
2,156,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,157,whole conversation,it is from a trusted site which is just use that as a subsidiary like.,-0.1,0.1
2,158,whole conversation,"yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure.",0.6,0.6
2,159,whole conversation,I think yeah that that that makes sense to certain extent but I am not that familiar with that array or string method.,-0.2,0.2
2,160,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,161,whole conversation,I understand yeah they all is different type.,-0.2,0.2
2,162,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,163,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,164,whole conversation,I think we need to move to the next task.,-0.4,0.4
2,165,whole conversation,I'm this is you you.,0,0
2,166,whole conversation,"you good on this, right ?",0.4,0.4
2,167,whole conversation,"I think it will work, I'm not able to run it for whatever reason.",-0.5,0.5
2,168,whole conversation,is a way you save that or you probably?,0,0
2,169,whole conversation,yeah it will stay save.,0.7,0.7
2,170,whole conversation,I think I can just create another file this.,-0.5,0.5
2,171,whole conversation,yeah you too.,0.6,0.6
2,172,whole conversation,you are literally helpful.,0.9,0.9
2,173,whole conversation,you're really really helpful.,0.9,0.9
2,174,whole conversation,"if it were left to me, I would really be confused.",-0.7,0.7
2,175,whole conversation,so yeah.,0.5,0.5
2,176,whole conversation,this is task two is saying.,-0.1,0.1
2,177,whole conversation,Assistance Bugger.,0.1,0.1
2,178,whole conversation,"A type of function persistence that takes in a positive parameter known and returns its multiplicative assistance which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in number until you reach a single digit, for example, inputs is greater than output has nine is greater than three because 3 * 9 = 27, 2 *7 = 14, 1 * 4 questions for 14K only one you have.",0,0
2,179,whole conversation,to keep multiplying and.,-0.1,0.1
2,180,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,181,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,182,whole conversation,go ahead save. to keep multiplying until we get a single digit number.,-0.1,0.1
2,183,whole conversation,"yeah, that's that's scope for it.",0,0
2,184,whole conversation,has 15 minutes and we need to write a function persistence.,-0.4,0.4
2,185,whole conversation,"you know we don't need another another task tutor, so we can create within this.",0,0
2,186,whole conversation,you feel we should greet within task one.,0.4,0.4
2,187,whole conversation,yeah yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,188,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,189,whole conversation,"Now, the least is task 2.",-0.2,0.2
2,190,whole conversation,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,191,whole conversation,within the same class just outside of the main method.,0,0
2,192,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,193,whole conversation,great.,0.9,0.9
2,194,whole conversation,it is great to see return a number put the giant persistence repairs.,0.9,0.9
2,195,whole conversation,you've been able to come up with anything.,0.6,0.6
2,196,whole conversation,Nope I'm trying to.,-0.7,0.7
2,197,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,198,whole conversation,I'm also trying to check online and see but getting.,-0.4,0.4
2,199,whole conversation,"in there every number, we can turn it into a string and string is an array then we can turn it back into numbers is there any easier way? and your favorite things.",0.4,0.4
2,200,whole conversation,oh I was looking at text too.,0,0
2,201,whole conversation,I haven't.,-0.3,0.3
2,202,whole conversation,you already got something on text 1.,0,0
2,203,whole conversation,oh I sorry.,-0.7,0.7
2,204,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,205,whole conversation,following uh.,0,0
2,206,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,207,whole conversation,I'm trying to you know convert the text number the receive number.,-0.3,0.3
2,208,whole conversation,we received into the function through a text.,-0.1,0.1
2,209,whole conversation,"so, then we then we can loop over every single digit or what we could have done is we could have you know module used the modulus to separate out the digits, but that is a different way.",-0.5,0.5
2,210,whole conversation,we can try.,0,0
2,211,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,212,whole conversation,great.,0.9,0.9
2,213,whole conversation,so it's.,0,0
2,214,whole conversation,"if I go zero, then the first and the second string will get.",-0.4,0.4
2,215,whole conversation,uh it doesn't make sense too.,-0.9,0.9
2,216,whole conversation,"if you, think so.",-0.2,0.2
2,217,whole conversation,"I don't think it makes sense because when the the i will be 0, the number the first is it and the second is it will get multiplied.",-0.8,0.8
2,218,whole conversation,"but when the i will be one, then the 2nd and the 3rd digit will be multiplied.",-0.4,0.4
2,219,whole conversation,"well, you already use one i greater than then normal lengths.",0.2,0.2
2,220,whole conversation,"oh, this is this is no problem because this is a local variable.",0,0
2,221,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,222,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,223,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6

2,225,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,226,whole conversation,I understand.,0,0
2,227,whole conversation,this will only work if we give it the only two two digit numbers.,-0.6,0.6
2,228,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,229,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,230,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,231,whole conversation,to use Google actually.,-0.4,0.4
2,232,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,233,whole conversation,"so, what I sent that.",-0.3,0.3
2,234,whole conversation,uh did you send anything?,-0.2,0.2
2,235,whole conversation,yes.,0.6,0.6
2,236,whole conversation,Sorry.,-0.7,0.7
2,237,whole conversation,I sent something yeah on the google not really trusted.,-0.7,0.7
2,238,whole conversation,but the first the first part makes sense.,0.1,0.1
2,239,whole conversation,it is singling out the digits uh static and dig some.,0,0
2,240,whole conversation,no problem.,0.6,0.6
2,241,whole conversation,to test that oh wow that's really simple.,0.7,0.7
2,242,whole conversation,interesting.,0.8,0.8
2,243,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,244,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,245,whole conversation,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,246,whole conversation,I am going to comment out this code and.,-0.2,0.2
2,247,whole conversation,sometimes you write a code takes so long and when you just see someone professional writing it very short and simple and.,-0.6,0.6
2,248,whole conversation,yeah and really it is it is understandable.,0.5,0.5
2,249,whole conversation,driver runs.,-0.3,0.3
2,250,whole conversation,oh OK OK.,0.5,0.5
2,251,whole conversation,so you just comment turns the one we want to the comments and use this.,-0.1,0.1
2,252,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,253,whole conversation,it's cool. that's cool.,0.9,0.9
2,254,whole conversation,"it’s just that we can we can go on are and see how responsive it is or if there are any errors, but I think there shouldn't be any error.",0,0
2,255,whole conversation,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,256,whole conversation,hopefully.,0.4,0.4
2,257,whole conversation,I'm asking to leave this one.,-0.8,0.8
2,258,whole conversation,I think they need more function that you committed.,-0.6,0.6
2,259,whole conversation,I will just advance.,0,0
2,260,whole conversation,So.,0,0
2,261,whole conversation,"yeah, I'm just going to take it out of the main function.",-0.4,0.4
2,262,whole conversation,so that it doesn't run every time.,-0.3,0.3
2,263,whole conversation,I run the main function.,0,0
2,264,whole conversation,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,265,whole conversation,great.,0.9,0.9
2,266,whole conversation,this I just sent you the rest of the code it wasn't complete.,-0.7,0.7
2,267,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,268,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,269,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,270,whole conversation,got it.,0.3,0.3
2,271,whole conversation,no problem.,0.6,0.6
2,272,whole conversation,"I, you know, there is a way we can check actually this one, but we need to go to an online compiler.",-0.4,0.4
2,273,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,274,whole conversation,one try.,0.3,0.3
2,275,whole conversation,you want to try using an online compiler to run it and see?,-0.2,0.2
2,276,whole conversation,and yeah.,0.3,0.3
2,277,whole conversation,yeah. that that thing.,-0.2,0.2
2,278,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,279,whole conversation,"if we have time, you can just try that.",0,0
2,280,whole conversation,we just try that.,0,0
2,281,whole conversation,let's see how are responsive that will be learn everyday yeah.,0.3,0.3
2,282,whole conversation,it is giving us a compilation error.,-0.8,0.8
2,283,whole conversation,compilation error?,-0.6,0.6
2,284,whole conversation,didn't just think that's because we're having two different task being from the same time.,-0.1,0.1
2,285,whole conversation,"uh, no. it's actually a single class.",-0.6,0.6
2,286,whole conversation,"and I don't think it should be a problem, but it is saying that a parenthesis.",-0.5,0.5
2,287,whole conversation,just  OK.,0,0
2,288,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,289,whole conversation,OK. is it showing any red lines to tell us where the error might be.,-0.2,0.2
2,290,whole conversation,would you just add the rest of the code the one I sent to the charts and see if.,0,0
2,291,whole conversation,"yeah, I think I. yeah I've added it to the uh solution already you can see in the main section.",0,0
2,292,whole conversation,the one you wrote it is I'm I've highlighted the section.,0,0
2,293,whole conversation,can you see it ?,0,0
2,294,whole conversation,ah I can't see yet.,-0.7,0.7
2,295,whole conversation,I am scrolling through.,-0.2,0.2
2,296,whole conversation,"um, it's I've highlighted it.",0.1,0.1
2,297,whole conversation,can you see it now?  is it in this isn't the zoom chat or right here in VSCode?,-0.2,0.2
2,298,whole conversation,in VSCode.,0,0
2,299,whole conversation,"oh, so sorry, I can’t still see.",-0.8,0.8
2,300,whole conversation,"But, no problem.",0.1,0.1
2,301,whole conversation,no worries.,0.7,0.7
2,302,whole conversation,no worries.,0.7,0.7
2,303,whole conversation,got you got it you got it.,0.5,0.5
2,304,whole conversation,"So, what do you suggest we do?",-0.1,0.1
2,305,whole conversation,should we stand by the the one you turned into comments?,-0.5,0.5
2,306,whole conversation,What do you feel?,-0.1,0.1
2,307,whole conversation,are you are you with me?,-0.1,0.1
2,308,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,309,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,310,whole conversation,"i am trying to run this program, but it is not working.",-0.8,0.8
2,311,whole conversation,still not working?,-0.8,0.8
2,312,whole conversation,nope.,-0.8,0.8
2,313,whole conversation,let's let's just try and modify the one you wrote and see if.,-0.1,0.1
2,314,whole conversation,no.,-0.5,0.5
2,315,whole conversation,I don't think because of of the second.,-0.6,0.6
2,316,whole conversation,uh problem we wrote.,-0.7,0.7
2,317,whole conversation,"I think it's because of the first one, but the one that we did.",0.2,0.2
2,318,whole conversation,"and we I we were confident that this kind of work, camel cases.",-0.1,0.1
2,319,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,320,whole conversation,understood.,0,0
2,321,whole conversation,we have the error from the first one. is that what you're trying to say.,-0.7,0.7
2,322,whole conversation,"yeah, right.",0.2,0.2
2,323,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
2,324,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,325,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,326,whole conversation,I see.,0,0
2,327,whole conversation,this time this is good training.,0.8,0.8
2,328,whole conversation,"Sorry, I just been having terrible cough.",-0.8,0.8
2,329,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,330,whole conversation,but the the weather has become really nice for the past couple of days.,0.3,0.3
2,331,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,332,whole conversation,"how was your new year, by the way?",0,0
2,333,whole conversation,it's going cool!,0.9,0.9
2,334,whole conversation,it's going cool!,0.9,0.9
2,335,whole conversation,"it's little stress, no no work hustle and bustle.",0,0
2,336,whole conversation,"So, it’s really do it yet.",0.1,0.1
2,337,whole conversation,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,338,whole conversation,so I think I don't see any problem.,0.4,0.4
2,339,whole conversation,so the third task is equal sides of an array.,0.1,0.1
2,340,whole conversation,I was disconnected for a few seconds.,-0.7,0.7
2,341,whole conversation,very sorry about that.,-0.8,0.8
2,342,whole conversation,I think.,0,0
2,343,whole conversation,No problem.,0.6,0.6
2,344,whole conversation,task time for second one is over.,-0.5,0.5
2,345,whole conversation,"So, move to the next third task.",-0.1,0.1
2,346,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,347,whole conversation,"so, it sounds a bit tougher.",0,0
2,348,whole conversation,We have 25 minutes for this any idea.,-0.3,0.3
2,349,whole conversation,yet Nope and.,0.1,0.1
2,350,whole conversation,so it's gonna be really tough.,-0.6,0.6
2,351,whole conversation,yeah I think it is one of those sorting problems.,-0.2,0.2
2,352,whole conversation,just one minute.,0.2,0.2
2,353,whole conversation,sure.,0.4,0.4
2,354,whole conversation,as I get to my airpods.,0,0
2,355,whole conversation,"so, we have been given an array debt the number the left digits and the right digits should be equal to the same number.",-0.1,0.1
2,356,whole conversation,it something like that.,-0.1,0.1
2,357,whole conversation,"How we can look over the array from the forward side and the backward side? and that's from iterative program, we can.",-0.1,0.1
2,358,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,359,whole conversation,let us trying to figure out any idea or maybe get some.,-0.1,0.1
2,360,whole conversation,let's try really understand question and check.,-0.3,0.3
2,361,whole conversation,And yeah just trying to start through some things too.,0,0
2,362,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,363,whole conversation,I'm just thinking how can we approach this problem.,-0.7,0.7
2,364,whole conversation,I'm thinking too.,0.2,0.2
2,365,whole conversation,but now alright dictate this to something challenging.,0,0
2,366,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,367,whole conversation,it's good.,0.8,0.8
2,368,whole conversation,it's good timing.,0.7,0.7
2,369,whole conversation,and all those found an answer for this problem.,-0.3,0.3
2,370,whole conversation,you found an answer?,0,0
2,371,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,372,whole conversation,"on online, on GitHub.",0,0
2,373,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,374,whole conversation,Cool! that's good.,0.9,0.9
2,375,whole conversation,alright.,0.4,0.4
2,376,whole conversation,How is it working?,-0.3,0.3
2,377,whole conversation,Are you trying to compile this one?,-0.2,0.2
2,378,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,379,whole conversation,"I'm I'm trying to, you know internalize this?",-0.4,0.4
2,380,whole conversation,how is this working?,-0.3,0.3
2,381,whole conversation,I can provide you the answer and you can also take a look at it and see how is it working.,0.1,0.1
2,382,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,383,whole conversation,good.,0.8,0.8
2,384,whole conversation,can you send on chat?,0,0
2,385,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,386,whole conversation,I'm still trying to understand.,-0.4,0.4
2,387,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,388,whole conversation,Understand and analyze it.,-0.1,0.1
2,389,whole conversation,The problem here is the code is written in JavaScript and we need to have it in Java.,-0.6,0.6
2,390,whole conversation,"oh in Javascript, not in Java.",-0.5,0.5
2,391,whole conversation,right.,0.3,0.3
2,392,whole conversation,What’s an idea?,-0.1,0.1
2,393,whole conversation,I can convert.,0.2,0.2
2,394,whole conversation,but I'm not sure that array dot slice and array dot reduce methods exist in Java.,-0.4,0.4
2,395,whole conversation,there's a lot.,0.6,0.6
2,396,whole conversation,"the array dot slice, dot reduce that would use think that's really really the major look clear one.",0.3,0.3
2,397,whole conversation,in Java as well.,-0.1,0.1
2,398,whole conversation,"if you could just check your the base, I could just really without convert.",-0.4,0.4
2,399,whole conversation,"if we are going convert then it’s going to be, it’s hard.",-0.6,0.6
2,400,whole conversation,this was possible.,0,0
2,401,whole conversation,How have you got?,0,0
2,402,whole conversation,I've got another solution in Java.,-0.3,0.3
2,403,whole conversation,but I don't understand this either.,-0.7,0.7
2,404,whole conversation,Java?,0,0
2,405,whole conversation,you don't understand it it's looking advanced?,-0.6,0.6
2,406,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,407,whole conversation,"array copy that’s something a built-in function, I think.",0,0
2,408,whole conversation,"array copy, what’s array copy.",-0.1,0.1
2,409,whole conversation,"It’s a special position, scope.",0,0
2,410,whole conversation,it’s sorting already.,-0.2,0.2
2,411,whole conversation,"destination position, and round for.",0.4,0.4
2,412,whole conversation,I will pull this source of works.,-0.1,0.1
2,413,whole conversation,so we're going to be.,0,0
2,414,whole conversation,very slow.,-0.8,0.8
2,415,whole conversation,did you to come up with something?,-0.1,0.1
2,416,whole conversation,"yeah. he somehow managed to understand the problem that, uh, you know the solution that we found.",0.7,0.7
2,417,whole conversation,so basically array copy is a built-in function and it takes the and you know source array the destination and the array the new array that it is going to produce and the destination all those sort of things.,0.3,0.3
2,418,whole conversation,so and and they're approaching it just like I was telling you that they're approaching it from the one side forward side of the array and the backward side of the area and they're trying to match you know those those elements and see when the sum of those elements are equal to one another.,-0.6,0.6
2,419,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,420,whole conversation,that's when they generate the results I think.,-0.3,0.3
2,421,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,422,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,423,whole conversation,"we still have time, right?",-0.1,0.1
2,424,whole conversation,I'm sorry?,-0.5,0.5
2,425,whole conversation,so we still have time?,-0.1,0.1
2,426,whole conversation,uh yeah maybe three or 4 minutes.,-0.1,0.1
2,427,whole conversation,I'm trying to join the live share  Yeah.,-0.1,0.1
2,428,whole conversation,Sure.,0.2,0.2
2,429,whole conversation,working for Google.,0,0
2,430,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,431,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,432,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,433,whole conversation,so you're saying that must have a lot of written functions.,-0.2,0.2
2,434,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,435,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,436,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,437,whole conversation,OK.,0.5,0.5
2,438,whole conversation,You got it.,0.3,0.3
2,439,whole conversation,at least one or two should work out of the three.,-0.1,0.1
2,440,whole conversation,yeah.,0.9,0.9
2,441,whole conversation,I'm really upset.,-0.9,0.9
2,442,whole conversation,it's not bad for you.,0.4,0.4
2,443,whole conversation,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
2,444,whole conversation,this week we could get feedback on which one works or which one doesn't work.,-0.6,0.6
2,445,whole conversation,just to me put on just one people you need to.,0,0
2,446,whole conversation,let's change it into an array.,-0.1,0.1
2,447,whole conversation,We actually almost done.,0,0
3,1,experience,"OK, let's start from the first task that we have to create  one function.",-0.3,0.3
3,2,experience,"Which convert Unless  this style to this style, remove underscore or dash and make the first letter Uppercase.",-0.2,0.2
3,3,experience,hmm OK.,0.6,0.6
3,4,experience,Hmm.,0,0
3,5,experience,Oh.,0.2,0.2
3,6,experience,They gave this information that we will accept this as input or it will be inside.,0,0
3,7,experience,We should decide each by ourselves or it doesn't matter?,-0.2,0.2
3,8,experience,"uh, they didn't say this is one will come as input or it will be just.",-0.7,0.7
3,9,experience,Does a fixed static.,0,0
3,10,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
3,11,experience,So we'll be OK.,0.3,0.3
3,12,experience,We can accept any input and output.,0.5,0.5
3,13,experience,Yeah also dash then.,0,0
3,14,experience,It will return a string.,-0.5,0.5
3,15,experience,If it is so in java.,-0.1,0.1
3,16,experience,Yes.,0.4,0.4
3,17,experience,Again we are accepting one input.,-0.2,0.2
3,18,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
3,19,experience,"Now, we should decide.",-0.1,0.1
3,20,experience,Oh how to search inside the string that we can find if there is any dash or underscore?,0,0
3,21,experience,hmm oh you can search if there is split method because it in c#.,-0.1,0.1
3,22,experience,"We have a split method, I believe we have it in Java also.",0,0
3,23,experience,the given regular?,-0.1,0.1
3,24,experience,"OK, it also helps.",0.8,0.8

3,564,experience,OK.,0.5,0.5
3,565,experience,we are going to beginning array..,0.2,0.2

3,568,experience,If.,-0.1,0.1
3,569,experience,There is no index.,-0.8,0.8

3,600,experience,They both are equal to Zero then add it.,0,0
3,601,experience,"OK, this type, the container and the arrays are equal to zero in this problem.",-0.3,0.3
3,602,experience,OK England 0 is place where the left side and right side are equal.,-0.1,0.1
3,603,experience,this part I also do not understand.,-0.8,0.8
3,604,experience,yeah here next zero here 20 how can be equal to the zero?,-0.3,0.3
3,605,experience,"OK, 40,50,60.",0.4,0.4
3,606,experience,Minus 20 yes it means empty array equals to the zero.,-0.5,0.5
3,607,experience,Hmm.,0,0
3,608,experience,And this part also equals to the zero.,-0.2,0.2
3,609,experience,That means we have to return index 0.,-0.8,0.8

3,626,experience,"Yeah, OK, yes.",0.7,0.7
3,627,experience,That means we have to return return 0.,-0.8,0.8
3,628,experience,as a result we have to return exactly that index is right to left.,-0.5,0.5
3,629,experience,"OK, OK, let's do it.",0.1,0.1
3,630,experience,But how do you?,0,0
3,631,experience,Uh.,0,0

3,633,experience,I usually write on the paper is easy to.,0.8,0.8
3,634,experience,we can create some methods.,0,0
3,635,experience,But first we have to find some solution.,-0.4,0.4
3,636,experience,How?,0,0
3,637,experience,How calculate them?,-0.1,0.1
3,638,experience,"OK, maybe we can do like that.",0,0

3,640,experience,"Uh, current from left side.",-0.2,0.2
3,641,experience,To the right side to left side you have can calculate this one yes to check if it's equal to left side of the that selected index.,0,0
3,642,experience,Let's we didn't find it.,-0.5,0.5
3,643,experience,Then we can move one more and calculate from there to here to then calculate this part oh I understand.,0,0
3,644,experience,Hmm.,0,0
3,645,experience,But I'm sure  We will not finish on time.,-0.4,0.4
3,646,experience,it will return int.,-0.3,0.3

3,517,sender,Can you change what you see here?,-0.1,0.1
3,518,sender,"OK, just click again.",0.1,0.1
3,519,sender,Run.,-0.3,0.3
3,520,sender,And what you see here is the same as yours.,-0.2,0.2
3,521,sender,can you drop down?,-0.2,0.2
3,522,sender,Is is this all are the same as I see in your screen  where should be array.,0,0

3,524,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
3,525,sender,"Uh, next time can give me.",-0.4,0.4
3,526,sender,"I.  we said that it's array or what happened, but we changed to it.",-0.2,0.2
3,527,sender,Hmm.,0,0
3,528,sender,"Then this multipation, month multipation.",-0.2,0.2
3,529,sender,"Then this one to one, it's one again.",0.1,0.1

3,532,sender,"Second time I'm getting five here and in 1,2,5,5, yes.",0.5,0.5
3,533,sender,Str number is string again.,-0.2,0.2
3,534,sender,This is number I'm converting into string and setting here.,0.2,0.2
3,535,sender,I this is not.,-0.5,0.5
3,536,sender,"This is uh, to get the string given the index and getting the number.",-0.2,0.2
3,537,sender,Yeah yes these one checking index this one.,0.3,0.3
3,538,sender,Maybe this is not working like that in the Java nokay this work in this way in C#.,-0.7,0.7
3,539,sender,Uh.,0,0
3,540,sender,Yeah.,0.7,0.7
3,541,sender,As.,0,0
3,542,sender,"OK, OK.",0.5,0.5
3,543,sender,I understand.,0,0
3,544,sender,Maybe it's not working in the Java.,-0.7,0.7
3,545,sender,You mean the you cannot write the index number as  we can change that structure.,-0.6,0.6
3,546,sender,But new char?,-0.2,0.2
3,547,sender,"OK, char at Ah OK, maybe not like that.",-0.4,0.4
3,548,sender,Char at In that.,-0.3,0.3
3,549,sender,"OK, I understand.",0.3,0.3
3,550,sender,Like this we should do like this.,0.8,0.8
3,551,sender,"OK, can you check?",0,0
3,552,sender,"Uh OK OK oh, char at was.",0.3,0.3
3,553,sender,Why?,-0.5,0.5
3,554,sender,But they also and this is converted.,0,0
3,555,sender,do you see char to how we call it.,-0.1,0.1
3,556,sender,How you can convert it to OK.,0,0
3,557,sender,This will be changed OK.,0,0
3,558,sender,Uh.,0,0
3,559,sender,Character get that value?,-0.2,0.2
3,560,sender,Something.,0.1,0.1
3,561,sender,What? value.,0,0
3,562,sender,Can you try?,-0.1,0.1
3,563,sender,Why?,-0.5,0.5
3,564,sender,Where?,0,0
3,565,sender,29..,0,0
3,566,sender,"OK, what do you see?",-0.1,0.1
3,567,sender,It's the same.,-0.1,0.1
3,568,sender,And there is a lot of string number cannot be resolved a lot of time strings.,-0.7,0.7
3,569,sender,String str number turn on the cannot be resolved where it's so.,-0.7,0.7
3,570,sender,"Oh yeah, we need to switch another task.",-0.2,0.2
3,571,sender,Let's do.,0.3,0.3
3,572,sender,for sure We need to.,0.4,0.4
3,573,sender,Let's switch to.,0,0
3,574,sender,"Actually, most of the logic of the program is done, but yeah, we need to switch.",-0.4,0.4
3,575,sender,I think.,0,0
3,576,sender,Unfortunately.,-0.8,0.8
3,577,sender,Let's do this.,0.3,0.3
3,578,sender,Actually we already overtime.,0,0
3,579,sender,"Because it's not about solving the task, it's about that how we are working together.",-0.6,0.6
3,580,sender,"So that's why,  it is about arrays.",-0.2,0.2
3,581,sender,we are going to beginning array..,0.2,0.2
3,582,sender,Want to the beginning of integers or job is to take the delay and find in an index end where the sum of the integer to the left of them.,-0.3,0.3
3,583,sender,"OK, is equal to the sum of integers to the right of them.",0,0
3,584,sender,If.,-0.1,0.1
3,585,sender,There is no index.,-0.8,0.8
3,586,sender,That would make this equal to minus one.,-0.6,0.6
3,587,sender,This one.,0,0
3,588,sender,"OK, let's say this is this.",-0.3,0.3
3,589,sender,"Your function will return the index three because at the third position of the array, the sum of the the website of the index one does not and some of the right and index both.",-0.3,0.3
3,590,sender,Equal.,0,0
3,591,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
3,592,sender,"Ah, OK.",0.3,0.3
3,593,sender,did You got no.,-0.7,0.7
3,594,sender,"Alright, as input you had to find start from here and here you have to sum them in which point, If the will be the same if say, let's say here.",-0.2,0.2
3,595,sender,"These parts, sum of these parts are the same.",0,0
3,596,sender,Some of this part you can index of the four.,0,0
3,597,sender,OK.,0.5,0.5
3,598,sender,"Uh yeah, let's say oh, your function will return the index one because at the first position of the array.",-0.1,0.1
3,599,sender,"Uh, uh.",-0.1,0.1
3,600,sender,"Oh, this is a bit complex task.",-0.4,0.4
3,601,sender,What is it?,-0.1,0.1
3,602,sender,you see it here?.,-0.1,0.1
3,603,sender,yes.,0.6,0.6
3,604,sender,Then two.,0,0
3,605,sender,Minus 49.,-0.5,0.5
3,606,sender,Again one.,-0.1,0.1
3,607,sender,"Uh, there's a lot of uh.",-0.2,0.2
3,608,sender,And slow down.,-0.7,0.7
3,609,sender,"Yeah, it's still me.",0,0
3,610,sender,"OK, it gives more more example.",0.1,0.1
3,611,sender,"OK, that's fine.",0.4,0.4
3,612,sender,"You are given the area OK at index zero, the left side.",-0.2,0.2
3,613,sender,In a zero even OK the right side.,-0.6,0.6
3,614,sender,And minus.,-0.8,0.8
3,615,sender,They both are equal to Zero then add it.,0,0
3,616,sender,"OK, this type, the container and the arrays are equal to zero in this problem.",-0.3,0.3
3,617,sender,OK England 0 is place where the left side and right side are equal.,-0.1,0.1
3,618,sender,What does it mean?,0,0
3,619,sender,I didn't understand.,-0.7,0.7
3,620,sender,"I index, 0 is the place where the left.",-0.3,0.3
3,621,sender,"I. And right side   OK, 40,50,60.",0,0
3,622,sender,Minus 20 yes it means empty array equals to the zero.,-0.5,0.5
3,623,sender,Hmm.,0,0
3,624,sender,And this part also equals to the zero.,-0.2,0.2
3,625,sender,That means we have to return index 0.,-0.8,0.8
3,626,sender,Hmm.,0,0
3,627,sender,Hmm.,0,0
3,628,sender,I do.,0.1,0.1
3,629,sender,this part did you understand?.,-0.2,0.2
3,630,sender,"Yes, this is zero.",-0.6,0.6
3,631,sender,"Yes, calculate them that it will be zero.",-0.5,0.5

3,639,sender,"Yeah, OK, yes.",0.7,0.7
3,640,sender,That means we have to return return 0.,-0.8,0.8
3,641,sender,as a result we have to return exactly that index is right to left.,-0.5,0.5
3,642,sender,"OK, OK, let's do it.",0.1,0.1
3,643,sender,But how do you?,0,0
3,644,sender,Uh.,0,0
3,645,sender,So let find some solution.,-0.7,0.7
3,646,sender,I usually write on the paper is easy to.,0.8,0.8
3,647,sender,we can create some methods.,0,0
3,648,sender,But first we have to find some solution.,-0.4,0.4
3,649,sender,How?,0,0
3,650,sender,How calculate them?,-0.1,0.1
3,651,sender,"OK, maybe we can do like that.",0,0
3,652,sender,Let's say we started from index 0.,-0.4,0.4
3,653,sender,"Uh, current from left side.",-0.2,0.2
3,654,sender,To the right side to left side you have can calculate this one yes to check if it's equal to left side of the that selected index.,0,0
3,655,sender,Let's we didn't find it.,-0.5,0.5
3,656,sender,Then we can move one more and calculate from there to here to then calculate this part oh I understand.,0,0
3,657,sender,Hmm.,0,0
3,658,sender,But I'm sure  We will not finish on time.,-0.4,0.4
3,659,sender,it will return int.,-0.3,0.3
