 Taleh hi I'm sending on the chat.  yes.  OK. oh.  How you wish. doesn't matter.  yes.  I opened it. Here. right. actually, we can and uh rename the file as we want. but, there just an instruction.  yes. sure, So, you will write or you will write. Yeah. I think so.  I was checking on the Google that if there has a specific method for that.  yes.  I search from google or somewhere. yeah. I have found the function for that. should I copy paste there ? I cannot.  maybe if you click on the read only. maybe you can change it to write access.  I still cannot.  now, we can use. OK. sorry, I think that is my bad. I was watching from the zoom. I thought that is the same screen. mm-hmm Yeah. uh it's just the recommendation. It is the rule of the java. we have to uh create the class the name class as the file name. file name. but I'm not sure whether the quick start is not the same name as task 1. but, it's still OK.  hmm. OK.  I just read it persistent bugger like your function.  yeah. and. uh and.  uh OK. so, we have two functions for. the first function is checking that number of digits and another function is splitting the character of each digit and multiply them. OK. that sounds good. Let me change the function name to be check number of digit. so, you have digit to string. I'm not sure. you can. OK. so, so, I think it should be a while loop instead of for. because we don't know when we will be finished. it’s only checking weather if. you’re right. yeah.  yes.  the index equal to zero you mean ah the index of the character, right? each character. each digit. no. actually, I think we should have a for inside. sorry I removed your code. OK. maybe index equal to zero and num length and index plus plus i. OK. I got your point. at this time we have to loop for all of characters. we have and convert it 1 by 1.  uh-huh and then let me think.  is that Infinity loop you know? because the number is always greater than one. so we have to.  OK. let’s comment out like this. right.  I just. sorry. maybe make this one.  OK. OK. as you want. Never mind. you've got two. OK. we can comment out. you got two. and we uh loop for every digit and then.  because uh if you see this one 39 is 3 * 9 and do like this until it's changed should be 1 digit. am I wrong? I'm not sure. I try I. I think that.  from me, is the outer loop while loop is cover all of this one. but inner loop is only one it just converts character. and then, put two multiply each other. now, we have to each one of these should be. but it is integer.  yes. number integer number of digits. we can. integer dot to string is.  OK. uh let me see. tell me.  yes. ha ha string and address.  one moment. OK. then we need do it again.  OK. so, the the result is string, right? oh sorry. ah that's my bad. I understand that what is the issue again.  oh really?  OK. So what you mean is is while, right? OK. I've got one. And another one we got eight. oh, cool!  oh it looks like we have no need to use for row, right?  we can do maybe something like this, int while equal to one. then, can we do something like this.  and then after a while, then the time.  uh because we need to run this function again and then because we need to convert this multiplier into string again and then check if  it’s more than one blah blah. than should go like this? I mean in the example. so is the multiply by 27, right? and then result is convert to the to string again. is I'm right?  uh.  Oh. you already got what the. yes.  yes. that's why I'm writing in. Yes. Sorry. index is not given to us. index is not given to us. yeah. we have to divide by ourselves. if it's equal.  The length is divided by two. uh yes. round down I think yes yeah. Math dot round. floor, because round may be round up.  dot floor return double. we have to and.  yes. almost ready.  And is that OK or not? because of our array length, 12345618. so the length is 8 / 2 is 4. OK. that's fine. oh. that's fine or not? OK. that's fine. because we used a greater than and start by zero. should be 023. OK. cool. and the results, we have to return. we have to return the position that makes two side equal to each other.  position is OK. some if true, we can we can return index. actually, I think it's OK. is OK. to reach the maximum is the number of array divide one by two. but we can stop before right I guess. and I’m not sure that in this programming language write like this or not. we can create something like boolean is equal to false and false. yes. and set is equal to true.  yes. exactly. and we have to return the index, right? the index position. So, we should define the index. no. should define i before going to the loop. and we can return. no, sorry. my fault. we can also break. I think we can return here because it's already found and we can return i. So, we have to traverse and until the mid of the array, right? so then you're right. should be like this. No. in your case uh, we have to traverse until. no actually uh, calculate like this works only when size is the same size. But, what I mean is in our case uh if we have abcde  or the first we should to calculate a and b plus c plus d plus e. not. We go to the first to another group like a plus b and calculate c plus d plus e plus is the same one. Not go further. But, this loop does not have behavior like this. Do you get it? So, we have to first maybe maybe two loops. uh let's try. Never mind. That's OK. Then let me try. you know this.  One moment. Let me try a calculation in a couple minutes. Are you saying you have a problem? if we calculate like I mean some of the array. It means if we go from the left side and the right side at the same pace. Do you know what I mean? a b c d e. but what I understand is like if we start from the left side and calculate for the left side and every time, we calculate the left side calculate all right side or no we have the same.  OK. you we can try your solution first. ok. let’s try. here try let’s put the. OK. I will try. oh what's happened. huh return. oh, you have to return everything and here you may be.  Yes. hey. what happened? OK. come on. It said index out of range. get index range. OK. let's see debug step by step. and we got index 4 for go inside.  four. yes. and then they explore. oh because of we use length. oh should have because this thing is equal to 8 minus zero. minus zero. it's gone. I already. OK. let's see another one, here.  should be equal, should be minus one because the array starts from zero you know what I mean?  yes.  ah yes. it should be enough i minus one. now it will. now I change it to 6. now it should return 2.  we couldn't finish the second one.
