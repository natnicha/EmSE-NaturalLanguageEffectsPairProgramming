 Taleh hi I'm sending on the chat.  yes.  OK. oh.  How you wish. doesn't matter.  yes.  I opened it. You still have to rename it. You also need to rename the java file. yes. sure, So, you will write or you will write.  the first character should be the capital letter.  I was checking on the Google that if there has a specific method for that.  yes.  I search from google or somewhere. yeah. I have found the function for that. should I copy paste there ? I cannot.  maybe if you click on the read only. maybe you can change it to write access.  I still cannot.  now, we can use. OK. sorry, I think that is my bad. I was watching from the zoom. I thought that is the same screen. mm-hmm I have to do the second part? OK. Let me read.  I didn't understand the task.  I mean. I mean the task description I don't understand like what does it come from us on the second task. Ah. so, I understand.  yeah. and. uh and.  the idea is to convert digit to string first to then check its length. if it's more than one, then we need to continue the process. so, we will check the the length of that and within the of each item of the array. I mean, the character of the string. then, convert it to integer again. then, multiplied by it. then, uh do it again and again until we reached the single digit. does it a sound good?   I'm sorry Uh. yes. let’s write all of them here. so, we can cut it. and then, put it in the second method.  you’re right. yeah.  um then we also need int, right?  and then um.  uh yes. do we have to integer function or to convert to integer ? Oh yeah.  I think we did something wrong in here. yeah. or we didn't? can we just do a just test it here? I'm not sure if it is well no not for example.  uh no. I just want to test this one. and how to run this ? I just want to and  they can just like.  I just. sorry. maybe make this one.  OK. OK. OK. OK. sorry. why do you write a for within the loop within the while? why?  I have another idea for that. actually, without a while loop. but it's OK. no problem.  it is num, isn’t it?  can I try this one. can you run this?  how about this one? can you run it again?  OK. then we need do it again.  ah that's my bad. I understand that what is the issue again.  yes. that should be array string and then while loop and then move.  It just oh remove this one and remove this one and then digit parse int.  ahha.  we can do maybe something like this, int while equal to one. then, can we do something like this.  and then after a while, then the time.  uh because we need to run this function again and then because we need to convert this multiplier into string again and then check if  it’s more than one blah blah. than should go like this? I mean in the example. so is the multiply by 27, right? and then result is convert to the to string again. is I'm right?  but if it is bigger than one time one not. so that one goes like this. and then Umm just give.  uh.  I found something like this. does work in my locals working. So then, no worries. OK. boolean. yes.  yes. that's why I'm writing in. Yes. Sorry. index is not given to us. index is not given to us. uh my logic is completely wrong. Yes. you are right. and if it is another function then.  and then should be math dot around or something like this.  It should be floor. Yes. OK. Is that correct? Array dot length. It has never used. OK uh if it return double OK Umm sorry. double. index. you are right. yes. almost ready.  oh OK. return a position. I think we have died from the game. so we don't, we don't need to calculate. we don't, we don't need. we need to divide by two. we first need to go to with the.  uh I think we can do something like this. if is equal to.  and we need to break from the loop function.  what is the next one? for example what if like this 1 1 is equal. and then 3 3 is equal. but all 6 6  is also equal. but in our case, if do not calculate the one because it will say that OK. it is fine, then it will break. I have one more idea. I can run down. you can continue there. afterwards, check Umm.  I but what. if but after the first iteration if you stop that station. you know what I mean? so, let's say that index is one and the i is one. and then, we get the first element and the last element, right? And then, some first will be one, some last will be one. Then, if you check if equal then break or return index to stop. It will not go further this. It could be.   I think I have an idea again.  So, we can sum first equal to sum last. Then is equal equal to true. OK.  OK. and then it came here the next step.  else if sum fist is not equal sum last and is equal equal to true return i minus one.  If not equal, otherwise, continue. What about this one? We are the same also dropdown. this array length minus one is the last item. So, in the first iteration, we get one from the first. And then we get one from the last. And then we add the first one to here and the last one to here. and then compare it. if it is equal to the is equal to true and then in the next step. for example. for example, it is now 2, and then it will continue at true here and add another one from the last second to here. both of them sum first sum it again 3 is equal. so it equal to true again, it can continues until it's exact equal. and if it is not equal, and then the previous value of this equal. it’s also true so. that means the previous iteration was correct. and there is another step after that. So, then it should to return that index minus one. I think, maybe we can just try check them out.  yeah then if it doesn't work, then we can continue with yours.  we have the double index instead what we have trying, not it does it.  OK. now, can you run? I hope it will work. OK. now let's continue with yours. index four? Ok. why zero minus i.  where is the debugger right now.  OK just go one step forward. should be one then.  yes. OK. yeah that's fine. OK. just really, so it's true. but should not be true, can you run again.  ah yes. it should be enough i minus one. now it will. now I change it to 6. now it should return 2.  we couldn't finish the second one.
