 OK, let's start from the first task that we have to create  one function. Which convert Unless  this style to this style, remove underscore or dash and make the first letter Uppercase. hmm OK. Hmm. Oh. They gave this information that we will accept this as input or it will be inside.  What was your question? because I didn't understand it.  Ah. OK. So we'll be OK.  Yeah also dash then. the given regular? OK, it also helps. OK. The stream split mental breaks during. OK, let's try. Input string, Blah blah blah. OK.  yeah yeah OK. Oh.  We have to find it.  but here should be something important for file also. and then. No. Invoice.  Yeah, and the import file.  Yeah, yeah, everything. Yes. Huh.  We have 8 minutes for this task.  It's OK. It's OK. Yeah.  I guess I already did. Oh. Check. Yeah, it's it's already installed.  we need some quick starter. We did it. We didn't. I mean, we can copy from here this grass quick start or could we go?  No, no, no, no, I didn't. Ah.  Yeah, we can do. Yeah, yeah. We can do the first, OK. Hmm. New, but new. New York. I'm. Yeah.  OK.  Yeah, yeah, this is.  Uh. I'm putting it back but good. Start from creating new projects and go from there. OK.  Oh. This is, this might not be your project yet. Uh, actually no.  Yeah, there. Uh, you know. Uh, here. There is a reason it's yes, and there is some appeared icons, you see. Oh.  No, I'm not doing anything. I'm just saying I'm working your screen. What you share right now with me there are in live share in the on the explorer.  I don't mean that one, I didn't mean that one.  Hmm. Actually I am surprised a bit. Because, um, I without the script. do you see My screen here. Oh, this new.   Oh uh, you can. This is not mine.  You live there left the live share so you can join with the same week and I think on the check. But we couldn't do the environment setting. This is not the one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right, there's an action normally we should have. We have a 20 minute for environment setup.   I pressed enter but it does not recognized. Oh. Render the meaning in the same. Meaning. OK. Now it should be here. OK, OK, now let's. Let s understand how to set environment. After that we can.  But you see my screen, yes? Just . Read. You mean?  this is semi related project given you by the. Teacher.  Uh, this is the project we are working together with study. Oh. Yeah. And. We you shared their projectory with me and that we can work together. But I don't see your screen anymore.  I can search for now. Live share. extension.  Yeah, it's just for a business idea, doing this for ourselves. I sent again to link to.  You couldn't join as young.  OK, so no I think. Now it should work.  Oh. I don't understand why.  No, I I didn't. Let me. Thank you. Something. And before each.  Ah, yes. Make me read right.  No. Make. No, yes. Uh, huh. List.  So as we do setup so lots of our time for task we can do for the next 10 minutes this task.  Yeah. OK, great. Thank you. OK. Oh. OK then, no need. This one has funded enough.   we can do this. We can work on the first Task, I think. OK, let's do it next 10 minutes.  This is for testing.  system out print ln  calls are the.  OK. It's going to be OK. . It's OK. OK.  Yeah, let's click again and do it. OK. Then we should install it, you know.  it should recognize.  Sorry, no.  I don't know. So that's why.  justs run this code?  I don't see your screen, but OK, now I see the bug console. But I don't see those problems. And the problems,  output? Yeah. Uh, no. I see no, nothing.  I saw Just problems are. I was thinking that you couldn't see too, that's why.  OK. Uh. Yeah, I did. Although. Insert public type my phone must be defined in its own file.  Yes. Oh,sorry sorry it is in the wrong part. This is plus. This is not OK.  No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here. OK, this is OK. I know the problem with the problem here must be defined n file. OK, let's uh go here. Oh yeah. Add new files.  Oh it for I can't move it and said that scanner class is used to get user input and we need to utilize scanner class import.  I don't know. I don't see your screen.  Uh, actually, uh, OK, now you see, yes, yes, I think. Before because I was writing. I just can't. Why?  Yeah, we did not scan anything. Yeah. This part OK, yes, yes.  OK, then you're removing this part. Yes, I did. Define is its own.  Yeah, I saw.  Yes. Yes. Uh, no. Seven. I see seven.  Just press run. I want to see what happened.  You. Call mom. There is 8 again the part of type program. OK my. OK. It is in own file Really. It's because the file name is different from the class name. Uh, if I understand correctly, no. We still could not set the environment. So let's let's set it.  Let's see it. Let's go to another one. OK, we can say that. Second one also will say let's say in. First one. Hmm.  it shouldn't matter .  Yeah. Sure. Ah, it works. Hmm. Doesn't. But that error was gone.  Hmm. That double s every time it double s.  Yes. Um, for OK, yes one error gone away but still we have three. The import solution cannot be resolved within like this.  I see, Exception insert main. Yeah. Just one, yeah three. We have a three import solution cannot be resolved.  no we should not, with what with solution?  And I already debug  it. OK. Yeah.  I don't see you.  none of them. Maybe we need to change it exactly we need to change to next text there first because.  Oh, OK.  Probably. With return int.  Hmm.  to the task one or  Yeah, I I remember that you deleted.  You can this result. Actually I already deleted the result and but the problem is when I wrote here. It Happens on your Visual Studio phone so late.  Yeah, no no you can. I just.  Yes, I did.  Public type tasks, too, must be defined on its own file.  Probably, actually I'm checking right now.? So. I do not understand.  for me it Is not stati.  In your in yours it was incorrect. It was incorrect but I incorrect and maybe it will double on your.  Actually we have to use.  run Just run this one because I mock some data, it should return three. I'm just testing it. I did, actually. I. run it.  Yeah, I did.  Public type task two must be defined. OK. oh, it gone way.  I don't see.  Yes, you did. Ah, here we have some error. Said that exception in thread main challenge error unresolved compilation problem. Task two cannot be resolved to a type. Oh, see, I see three.  Now the setup done here.  Yeah. I'm reading the solution even. I mean task. We need to use loop again. String. um,  Let us try it OK.  I am also not good.  And value. Yeah, until.  Maybe you can use the converter.  OK. OK  Ten let  me understand 10 is 1. Here.  Hmm.  OK.  Yes, yes, yes.   It will do yes OK? Yeah I did. There is some errors.  You have you don't have any bug.  OK, OK, OK. Yes, I do.   Oh.  It should return 5.  Problem is.  Here there is in my code like return integer, integer and it return together. I don't see in your screen. Yes, it's different from yours.  Yes yes you do. There Is 1 error is gone away and the secondary type of expression must be an array type, but it resolved to string.  Yes, I did.  Let me check from the beginning. String number. And. Yes. Yes, this is and also at the end. OK. Um. String number should be array because we. String number we see set as string ? But uh 10? In 13  Here, let's say this 15 yes, 15 yes. I'm getting the one from here. First time. Yes, I'm getting the one. Yes. I mean for example in the beginning we said that str number is trhree and then inside for loop we rewrite that. Uh, before to change it to integer, we said that it's array string number we. Write Yeah, I understand. But uh yeah, I understood that this is the index number I, but here it shows that this especially highlight the str number.  Hmm. a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe there is as array Java. Uh, if if it's not working like that,  is not Work work. Things like this. Good.  Yes. A parse in to string time during this applicable for the agreement. For Char it's not applicable. Parse in string.  uh. One connect.  Yes, I can wait. Unreachable code.  line number 29.  No, it's not the same. Really, really interesting.  I see a number. and. 15 oh now. No it's the same.  Really. No.  this should work like that. But. OK, OK.  OK. And then again here we will need it. OK. OK.  yes Uh, we we will get.  Uh, it's a bit complex. Uh, I mean. es, yes, I see this one one,  OK, let's go step by step.  this part I also do not understand.  yeah here next zero here 20 how can be equal to the zero? oh, left side and. Right side are equal. For example, UM, in the third example, minus 80. Uh, yeah, yeah, you're you're you're from the same. Oh, this is minus 10, yes. Uh, this is uh. Minus 70 , -60. Minus 50. Yes. Hmm. I'm 50. I understand. Yes. Yes. Yes, and in next 0. Uh, it says. Uh. Next part of this index zero is empty array. Yes, there is no element inside. Yeah.  It's like my friend.  And actually I didn't understand the OK. The right side is the third one.  OK. Yeah, yeah, OK.   yes, yes.  right part of the. Zero.  Like right part of the index 0. Yes. Equal to zero if you are. Left part of the Zero is part of. Yes, yes, yes.  OK. OK.   Ohkay. Somehow they look like that. OK, let's do and I will understand. With me even difficult.  Yes, from what we will start to thinking about.  I'm going to begin, Array with integer. Minus. 15.  Hmm. It's the okay.  yes.  until i. They're not minus, minus. Minus, minus yet. Oh.  I think you can because I seen some codes that. When they sign, they use. There is not such example.  Yeah.  Oh, That it's just a variable you give. Uh we here we have 3-4 loop every time I'm giving the new name I. You can say anything what you want.  yes. Oh error. Can you show me the line number 8? Saying set. Quotes. To complete the code. The same. Yes, it's the same. Yeah, one is solved line 14. Line 35 said that. It said, UM, syntax error on token that. At expected after this document. It shows like line certified, but I'm not sure.  oh okay, I will do like that. Oh. OK. Yes you can test like that.  oh 5 comes, it works. See on your screen. Let's test from here. It will be. Umm. Can you click?  Yes, it's good. It should be one.  OK.
