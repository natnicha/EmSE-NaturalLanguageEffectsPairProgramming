 OK let's start as we decided already. uh you are experienced so let's start first with you. you are the driver and i can read the navigator for this task at least please and then we can see what we can do. What was your question? because I didn't understand it.  Ah. isn't written there? Complete metafunction converts. And. I think this will be input. Yeah. And what we will do here we will firstly change to the camel case and secondly we need to remove the underscore here.  OK. Uh, yeah, also there is that ship. Yeah. OK, nice. Let's try one method here. Didn't see.  We can Google. We can use Google and get it. yeah yeah OK. Oh.  We have to find it.  Maybe we need to write inside of class or? Oh, please.  What did what do you have said? Sorry. When you went there. Yeah. And maybe we can write inside. Yeah, and the import file.  Yeah, yeah, everything. Yes. Huh.  We have 8 minutes for this task.  It's OK. It's OK. Yeah.  Wait.  I guess I already did. Oh. Check. Yeah, it's it's already installed.  So, uh, let's go step by step.  we need some quick starter. We did it. We didn't. I mean, we can copy from here this grass quick start or could we go?  No, no, no, no, I didn't. Ah.  Yeah, we can do. Yeah, yeah. We can do the first, OK. Hmm. New, but new. New York. I'm. Yeah.  Maybe because of that I shared this one I need to. And and able to create a folder and I need to check let me check.  yes. I am sharing.  What was that?  why didn't you want to create a new project?  Uh, we can uh. Here we can create different project like a folder and on the folder file.  Yeah, there. Uh, you know. Uh, here. There is a reason it's yes, and there is some appeared icons, you see. Oh.  No, I'm not doing anything. I'm just saying I'm working your screen. What you share right now with me there are in live share in the on the explorer.  There up to my blog there is life share Workspace live share with bold letters. Here some there is add folder option. One one more quick, one more time. Yeah, yes, here in right folder and file you can new file and new folder. Do you mean Maybe, I mean. Hmm. Actually I am surprised a bit. Because, um, I without the script.  Can you also send me that link with this quick start Java?   I see yours.   Oh uh, you can. Is this yours?  You live there left the live share so you can join with the same week and I think on the check. Actually time is up for this task.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right, there's an action normally we should have. We have a 20 minute for environment setup.  Did you, uh, try to join again? Uh, you know, after your name is there. Yes, that is true. So you should see now.  Gulnar, I want to reload . Let me check. Um, because each time I need to give it access to you. But I couldn't see again you in the room. Yeah. Did you maybe? Uh, let me share.  Let me restart the video go to studio because. Uh, this is the project we are working together with study. Oh. Yeah. And. We you shared their projectory with me and that we can work together. To turn are you here?  Yeah, I will again send you. I just reward the Visual Studio good. While I was suspicious about maybe I didn't complete the installation of Java package. So, OK? Oh, Yeah, it's just for a business idea, doing this for ourselves. I sent again to link to.  You couldn't join as young.  Can you try once again?  OK, so no I think. Now it should work.  Oh. I don't understand why.  Invite participant. Trying to see. Before, at least you were able to join. Now.  Ah, yes. Make me read right.  could you edit or no?  So as we do setup so lots of our time for task we can do for the next 10 minutes this task.  Yeah.  I refresh again because package was installed but I didn't reload the Visual Studio code.   we can do this. We can work on the first Task, I think. OK, let's do it next 10 minutes.  This is for testing.  system out print ln  calls are the.   So I see as I remember.  Wait. What happened? . One and one. OK.  We don't. I don't understand. Actually it's installed. Debugger for Java is already installed. Uh, it doesn't even. Right. So I don't really understand.  I see a little bit different. Maybe I'm the host. There is a uninstall button disable. Switch to previous version. Let's use code. Press F5 to. On the code that we need.  Sorry, no.  I don't know. So that's why.  What I need to do   Yes, there is a some bugs.  yes, there is. There is a lot of them. Yeah. Can you see? OK, perfect.  output? Yeah. Uh, no. I see no, nothing.  I saw Just problems are. I was thinking that you couldn't see too, that's why.  OK. Uh. Yeah, I did. Although. Insert public type my phone must be defined in its own file.  Maybe we need to import? In own file. Here we have two time public, with public static. Why do we have? Here in the sorting in the wrong part. No, this is here.  No. I mean, I mean do you know what I mean? Here in 13 row 13, line 13 there is public static void and again public static void.  Oh it for I can't move it and said that scanner class is used to get user input and we need to utilize scanner class import.  Wait. You also ready? Oh, you couldn't see what I'm writing?  Why it is so?  Uh, actually, uh, OK, now you see, yes, yes, I think. Before because I was writing. I just can't. Why?  Yeah, we did not scan anything. Yeah. This part OK, yes, yes.  Where is the two main?  Yes, I did. Define is its own.  Yeah, I saw.  You couldn't? Yes. Yes. Uh, no. Seven. I see seven.  And what did you say?  OK. Yes, I did. What do you see? What you see there is. Two task, one tab on your Visual Studio code. Why?  Our time is up, so we can go for other task.  Uh, is that because of this?  Yet still, we didn't. Yeah. Let's take this.  So do you want to write inside one file or with your intention? Yeah. Sure. Ah, it works. Hmm. Doesn't. But that error was gone.  Hmm. What was happening when you wanted to write? Remove it?  Yes. Um, for OK, yes one error gone away but still we have three. The import solution cannot be resolved within like this.  Who do you see the errors? Or?  Yeah. Just one, yeah three. We have a three import solution cannot be resolved.  What's the name of our class here? That's why we need to import task  one no? with what with solution?  And I already debug  it. OK. Yeah.  What's happened?  need To click problems on programs or?.  none of them. Maybe we need to change it exactly we need to change to next text there first because. OK, OK. OK. So. Function. Transistor. It is positive parameter normal and return is complicated persistent which is among row trying to much more complicated business and now until you reach the single digit. OK. I mean. Because. Hmm. OK. Uh, for this we have to open new file or we we can we can.  I already open the two more fire for other tasks then we can upload.  OK, we can. Second one, second one with it said.  Hmm.  to the task one or  Yeah, I I remember that you deleted.  You can this result. Actually I already deleted the result and but the problem is when I wrote here. It Happens on your Visual Studio phone so late.  Yeah, no no you can. I just.  Yes, I did.  Public type tasks, too, must be defined on its own file.  Probably, actually I'm checking right now.? So. I do not understand.  Where is freedom static? Static. it was on my Visual Studio like stati.  In yours I see that it's correct but.  So strange. So strange.  Actually we have to use.  And do you mean would would? Do you wanna from me to test ? I did, actually. I. run it.  Do you want one of from me to run this code?  I did several times.  Public type task two must be defined. OK. oh, it gone way.  I don't see.  Yes, you did. Ah, here we have some error. Said that exception in thread main challenge error unresolved compilation problem. Task two cannot be resolved to a type. Oh, see, I see three.  Now the setup done here.  Yeah. I'm reading the solution even. I mean task. We need to use loop again. String. um,  Let us try it OK.  I am also not good.  And value. Yeah, until.  integer parse it? Maybe you can use the converter.  OK. OK  Ten let  me understand 10 is 1. Here.  Hmm.  OK.  Yes, yes, yes.   It will do yes OK? Yeah I did. There is some errors.  You have you don't have any bug.  OK, OK, OK. Yes, I do.   Oh.  Who did you? It returned five.  Problem is.  Here there is in my code like return integer, integer and it return together. I don't see in your screen. Yes, it's different from yours.  Yes yes you do. There Is 1 error is gone away and the secondary type of expression must be an array type, but it resolved to string.  Yes, I did.  Let me check from the beginning. String number. And. Yes. Yes, this is and also at the end. can you drop down? Is is this all are the same as I see in your screen  Um. String number should be array because we. String number we see set as string ? But uh 10? In 13  we said that it's array or what happened, but we changed to it.  Hmm.  Yes. I mean for example in the beginning we said that str number is trhree and then inside for loop we rewrite that. Uh, before to change it to integer, we said that it's array string number we. Write Yeah, I understand. But uh yeah, I understood that this is the index number I, but here it shows that this especially highlight the str number.  Hmm. You mean the you cannot write the index number as  is not Work work. Things like this. Good.  Yes. A parse in to string time during this applicable for the agreement. For Char it's not applicable. Parse in string.  uh. do you see char to how we call it.  What? value. Yes, I can wait. Unreachable code.  line number 29.  No, it's not the same. Really, really interesting.  I see a number. and. 15 oh now. No it's the same.  And there is a lot of string number cannot be resolved a lot of time strings. String str number turn on the cannot be resolved where it's so. Oh yeah, we need to switch another task. Let's do.  for sure We need to. Let's switch to.  Actually, most of the logic of the program is done, but yeah, we need to switch. I think. Unfortunately. Let's do this. Actually we already overtime.  Because it's not about solving the task, it's about that how we are working together. So that's why,  it is about arrays.  did You got no. What is it?  es, yes, I see this one one,  OK, let's go step by step.  What does it mean? I didn't understand. I index, 0 is the place where the left. I. And right side  oh, left side and. Right side are equal. For example, UM, in the third example, minus 80. Uh, yeah, yeah, you're you're you're from the same. Oh, this is minus 10, yes. Uh, this is uh. Minus 70 , -60. Minus 50. Yes. Hmm. I'm 50. I understand. Yes. Yes. Yes, and in next 0. Uh, it says. Uh. Next part of this index zero is empty array. Yes, there is no element inside. Yeah.  It's like my friend.  And actually I didn't understand the OK. The right side is the third one.  OK. Yeah, yeah, OK.   yes, yes.  right part of the. Zero.  What did you say?  Yes, yes, yes.  OK. OK.   Ohkay. Somehow they look like that. OK, let's do and I will understand. With me even difficult.  Yes, from what we will start to thinking about.  I'm going to begin, Array with integer. Minus. 15.  Hmm. It's the okay.  yes.  Until end of the array? OK,  I think you can because I seen some codes that. When they sign, they use. There is not such example.  Yeah.  What's the K?  OK.  yes. Oh error. Can you show me the line number 8? Saying set. Quotes. To complete the code. The same. Yes, it's the same. Yeah, one is solved line 14. Line 35 said that. It said, UM, syntax error on token that. At expected after this document. It shows like line certified, but I'm not sure.  Do you know what it shows? T.? Calculate equal side of array and underline certified. Can you drop down? T. 10. H wait I will Do. what it says 5. 5 comes.  could you see? No, I don't see it.   comes three.  So our time is also up.
