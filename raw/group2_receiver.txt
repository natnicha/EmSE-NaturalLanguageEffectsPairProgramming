 yeah. sure.  again quick so.  OK.  OK,  yeah. sure.  Yes.  yeah, OK. great.  Oh, Yeah.  OK.  yeah. sure.  Yes, of course. no. not you not.  am I supposed to see what you are doing? I am supposed to see what I'm doing over.  Yes. I'm seeing that what you are typing. yeah, I'm seeing what you're typing. OK. just a minute.  Did you see what I typed? I can see what you type. OK.  my first language was actually Java but I haven't practiced it since a long time.  OK. um it's a great language that. no, I did not I did not. start I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript . yeah. yeah, yeah.  yeah, right. so this is basically the basic template to start a Java program.  OK. training we're here for the time being. uh yeah. now I can see what you're typing. yeah. no, just uh I just created a template string so that I can work with it in in the method that I'm going to write.  I'm sorry. I’m not understand. yeah, no problem. it's just I'm just thinking and.  yeah, sure. sure.  yeah.  yes.  You are trying to finding underscore on your keyword.  OK.  uh that's a dash and the next one is going to be underscore. we need to have equals. yes. So what I'm checking here is if I get an underscore or a dash within my string. I am going to change something within this string. oh. at least, I can help to check Google I think that's allowed. OK. Good. keep going while I am checking . I would just be swipe, but it's looking a bit advanced.  oh, I'm so much work guys.  sorry?  uh, I am not sure though. is it working? OK. yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure. I think yeah that that that makes sense to certain extent but I am not that familiar with that array or string method. yeah. OK. I think we need to move to the next task. I'm this is you you. I think it will work, I'm not able to run it for whatever reason.  yeah it will stay save. I think I can just create another file this.  so yeah.  to keep multiplying and.  yeah, that's that's scope for it. you feel we should greet within task one.  Yeah. within the same class just outside of the main method.  you've been able to come up with anything.  OK. I'm also trying to check online and see but getting.  and your favorite things. oh I was looking at text too. I haven't. you already got something on text 1. oh I sorry. OK. following uh.  OK. great. so it's.  if you, think so.  well, you already use one i greater than then normal lengths.  yeah. yeah. yes. yeah. yes. I understand.  OK. OK. uh did you send anything? but the first the first part makes sense. it is singling out the digits uh static and dig some. no problem. to test that oh wow that's really simple. interesting.  yeah and really it is it is understandable.  oh OK OK. so you just comment turns the one we want to the comments and use this. OK. it's cool. that's cool. it’s just that we can we can go on are and see how responsive it is or if there are any errors, but I think there shouldn't be any error.  I think they need more function that you committed. I will just advance. So. alright. great.  OK. OK. yeah. got it. no problem.  OK. one try. you want to try using an online compiler to run it and see?  OK. if we have time, you can just try that. we just try that. let's see how are responsive that will be learn everyday yeah.  compilation error? didn't just think that's because we're having two different task being from the same time.  just  is it showing any red lines to tell us where the error might be. would you just add the rest of the code the one I sent to the charts and see if. ah I can't see yet. I am scrolling through.  is it in this isn't the zoom chat or right here in VSCode? oh, so sorry, I can’t still see. But, no problem. no worries. no worries. got you got it you got it. So, what do you suggest we do? should we stand by the the one you turned into comments? What do you feel? are you are you with me?  still not working? let's let's just try and modify the one you wrote and see if.  OK. understood. we have the error from the first one. is that what you're trying to say. OK. OK. I see. this time this is good training.  yeah. but the the weather has become really nice for the past couple of days.  it's going cool! it's going cool! it's little stress, no no work hustle and bustle. So, it’s really do it yet. I was disconnected for a few seconds. very sorry about that. I think. OK. so, it sounds a bit tougher. We have 25 minutes for this any idea. so it's gonna be really tough.  just one minute.  as I get to my airpods. OK. let us trying to figure out any idea or maybe get some. let's try really understand question and check. And yeah just trying to start through some things too. I'm thinking too. but now alright dictate this to something challenging.  it's good. it's good timing.  you found an answer?  OK. Cool! that's good.  yeah. I'm I'm trying to, you know internalize this? how is this working? I can provide you the answer and you can also take a look at it and see how is it working.  yeah.  yeah. oh in Javascript, not in Java.  What’s an idea? there's a lot. the array dot slice, dot reduce that would use think that's really really the major look clear one. if you could just check your the base, I could just really without convert. if we are going convert then it’s going to be, it’s hard. this was possible. How have you got? Java? you don't understand it it's looking advanced?  it’s sorting already.  yeah. he somehow managed to understand the problem that, uh, you know the solution that we found. so basically array copy is a built-in function and it takes the and you know source array the destination and the array the new array that it is going to produce and the destination all those sort of things. so and and they're approaching it just like I was telling you that they're approaching it from the one side forward side of the array and the backward side of the area and they're trying to match you know those those elements and see when the sum of those elements are equal to one another.  OK.  yeah.  I'm sorry?  uh yeah maybe three or 4 minutes. Yeah. Sure.  yeah. yeah.  yeah. I'm really upset.  let's change it into an array.
