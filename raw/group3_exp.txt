 OK, let's start from the first task that we have to create  one function. Which convert Unless  this style to this style, remove underscore or dash and make the first letter Uppercase. hmm OK. Hmm. Oh. They gave this information that we will accept this as input or it will be inside.  We should decide each by ourselves or it doesn't matter?  uh, they didn't say this is one will come as input or it will be just. Does a fixed static.  OK. So we'll be OK.  We can accept any input and output.  Yeah also dash then. It will return a string. If it is so in java. Yes. Again we are accepting one input. OK. Now, we should decide. Oh how to search inside the string that we can find if there is any dash or underscore? hmm oh you can search if there is split method because it in c#. We have a split method, I believe we have it in Java also. the given regular? OK, it also helps. OK. The stream split mental breaks during. OK, let's try. Input string, Blah blah blah. OK.  here We should have a string array. Uh, we should find which library we should import, because it will not come without importing. Let's see if it will. OK. Oh, it doesn't. Correct. Instead of us yes.  What should we import?  We can try like that. First. Let's say you can't uh, first element of the array. Hmm. We can.  but here should be something important for file also. and then. No. Invoice.  Shouldn't be matter what makes. One shouldn't be matter.  Yeah, here. I believe we should import some files here. For example to use string here should be some important files that you can use string Please. This is yet to come. What do you say? Is it allowed to check from eclipse?  How many minutes we have?  Maybe we. OK.  Oh. Here it's it's OK, but there. Doesn't.  I will Package. For example, we already installed all needed packages. Or we should we can add more packages.  OK. Hmm. Maybe we can. Visual studio code java. Here. Install new according package for Java. You know. Who opened this project for us? They they used this product.  maybe we can start from create new project.  OK.  Yeah, yeah, this is.  Uh. I'm putting it back but good. Start from creating new projects and go from there. OK.  Oh. This is, this might not be your project yet. Uh, actually no.  Structure should be like that, but project normally then I'm creating new project. Umm. Here I don't know how it's in Java but but in C# under solution you can create a lot of projects like project file extension for example. It can be console projects. Just console will show like this. This is console project for example. Displayed in the console.  Are you managing? Are you? Anything. You know that? The only one. Because I, uh, you couldn't. No, no, I don't like what I'm doing.  I don't mean that one, I didn't mean that one.  see it it's understand that this is Java code Java project. But in our case it didn't understand that this is Java OK. But there you see create our project we should create a project. Under general project we can add Java files.  yes and we can open Visual Studio a first page or it should be somewhere here. File, new file, new window, open file and folder. Oh, it's different than Visual Studio. It's different here. do you see My screen here. Oh, this new.  Do you see your phone? Anything row? This is not mine.  What is it? Oh,  OK, OK, this is OK. This is because of live share. That's why it's like that. Yes. OK, fine. OK. But we couldn't do the environment setting. This is not the one.  We should set environment after that we can start to solve task. Why not? Why didn't do that you actually assaulted? Maybe you already know it. No, this is almost first time I'm using the Visual Studio. We are you programming with. Studio came. When? And then?  OK then start from beginning. Let's set the environment after that. Hmm.   I pressed enter but it does not recognized. Oh. Render the meaning in the same. Meaning. OK. Now it should be here. OK, OK, now let's. Let s understand how to set environment. After that we can.  But you see my screen, yes? Just . Read. You mean?  this is semi related project given you by the. Teacher.  Or who created this? My blog part. But I don't see your screen anymore.  I can search for now. Live share. extension.  Can you set this is project? Are you , work together with tALHE?. He is. We are again the same. I put the same purpose.  this collaboration station is no longer active. Yeah. OK. Open. Yes. He's. And you drive, right. Again the same problem. Oh. Even.  Is this same link?.  It didn't ask anything for me.  Uh.  No, I I didn't. Let me. Thank you. Something. And before each.  You see me? Yeah, now.  No. Make. No, yes. Uh, huh. List.  New problem. The public type program must be defined in its own file. Only files. You can add file here. New plan, OK. No.  OK. OK, great. Oh yeah, here it recognize this is java file . This is fine.  OK, great. Thank you. OK. Oh. OK then, no need. This one has funded enough.  Are you? OK. OK, OK. So now you can start to make task? What should we do? And Now we need main class in Java to test it. Name of the? Thanks. hmm.  what was named in java. Thanks. Sorry. Yes, now you can. Oh. 3. No. Yeah. OK. It's going to be OK. . It's OK. OK.  Yeah, let's click again and do it. OK. Then we should install it, you know.  it should recognize.  Maybe we should import that file here. The name of debugger. What's the name of that package, I think or the one or?  The debugger for java extension is not available for web. Oh OK hey, this is not available for web.  You can do it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  justs run this code?  I don't see your screen, but OK, now I see the bug console. But I don't see those problems. And the problems,  You see the output?  What do you see?  not applicable argument chart OK, it shouldn't be char. It should be string run it again.  It's own file?.  Yes. Oh,sorry sorry it is in the wrong part. This is plus. This is not OK.  This one shouldn't be here. This one is a single and this is one more this one. OK. OK. And we. Why it shows this incorrect must be defined in known file.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here. OK, this is OK. I know the problem with the problem here must be defined n file. OK, let's uh go here. Oh yeah. Add new files.  What it say? Problem is not this one but let s do it.  Solution. I don't know. I don't see your screen.  What you write.  Because of system scanner when we scan anything.  So we have two main. Where is it come from.  OK, then you're removing this part.  Can you put from?  Oh, you see the error?   is there 10 problems?  Then this is the old. You can do again?. I close it because.  Just press run. I want to see what happened.  You. Call mom. There is 8 again the part of type program. OK my. OK. It is in own file What do you mean here? We can search for it. We have written following.  Really. It's because the file name is different from the class name. Uh, if I understand correctly, no. We still could not set the environment. So let's let's set it.  Let's see it. Let's go to another one. OK, we can say that. Second one also will say let's say in. First one. Hmm.  it shouldn't matter .  can you run this one? OK then great, I know what's the problem then OK, we don't need this part. Uh, putting it here? Remove this from here? Hmm. OK. I don't have this one. Removing this one. Inside the it should be. What it's like when I try to remove this part? That double s every time it double s. Can you run this one? OK, OK, OK, OK, I know what's the problem. OK, task one. OK. Ca you run again? What you see. At one.  I see, Exception insert main. Is it problem part? no we should not,  Oh, can you debug it?  Oh, I mean you here, I don't know how to put breakpoints. debug part for evaluate session? Um, you started?? Did you put some breakpoint?in which line?.  in order to debug we have to put breakpoint there. OK, OK. OK. So. Function. Transistor. It is positive parameter normal and return is complicated persistent which is among row trying to much more complicated business and now until you reach the single digit. OK. I mean. Because. Hmm. OK. Uh, for this we have to open new file or we we can we can.  Oh, OK.  Probably. With return int.  What to put the? Persistence forest. What kind of? Yeah, it's says except one input, but in the first task. It didn't say that.  OK. First putting here also one main method to check. You see here it's double again. It puts this one here.  Yeah it was the problem?  Yeah, I'm getting it from here and putting. Class name is now class two. Class name  should be upper. Yeah. Let's.  Ah, OK, maybe that's why. Yeah. What did you did? No. Now it's updated.  OK, I'm sending number, let s saying this one. This. No, it is int not integer OK. Return. I'm just testing just, uh, can you click the run?  Do you see any any unresolved compilation problem in the main? Why there is no problem?  Oh why? Where you see problem?  for me it Is not stati.  In your in yours it was incorrect. It was incorrect but I incorrect and maybe it will double on your.  So we had to use this live share one share or it's optional?  OK. I didn't like it. Everything looks good in your page. Your screen. Can you test it?  run Just run this one because I mock some data, it should return three. I'm just testing it.  It's possible to run this file? If Not possible. No need to continue. We have to set the environment.  Yeah, I did.  What you see?  Five past two must be defined. OK, let's maybe it's because of upper and changing.  Now you can run it  It's OK, you see the input? Is there no problem? You should see Three, in the console You don't see.  OK, great. Now we can do that.   OK. OK. OK. OK. Now, we have to think about the solution. I found One solution, but I'm not sure it.  Oh. we can convert it to string then say our inputs 375 OK and. Get all the digits. And. Oh. Calculate them. Let's repeat it until the digit is 1. Uh, one digit  is there.  OK, but this is my solution we can try. OK. 3. Then. This number.  value okay. 3 value of. And while while Um. Great the number than 1. Then one yes.  Yeah, if it's one. Then it will be, yeah, we will return this one back. This one but uh, connecting to int. OK. Uh,string to int in java  clean.  Why you can't see mine? Of course.   value of this one yes. now. We will check. Uh, let's say this is 325. Hmm. Oh. Str number.  Then you're getting the length. Hmm. Is it in? And. Oh. And. OK. And. for. Yes. Umm. OK, OK. OK. OK. And yes, zero. Yes and 10 equal, yes. Str number. Uh, this one? I'm getting this from here. put  In this inside. Maybe i yes. Uh. Let us do it one. Yeah.  OK, after all of them, Str number again will be this one. Uh, no, not this one.  Yes. Uh. Of not str. Yeah, this one. Will be 10.  next. It should work like that. Let's say we accept 325 yes no string  325 because length more than one we entered here. Uh, we get blanks. No need to do this one. You can put it here.  Now we said some be OK 1,10th no, we are calculating it's 3. 3. This is 3,3,2,6, yes, 35, yes. Thank you. Then will be 30. Yes. Now our new number is Str number is 13. Yes. And he explained more than one. Yes, it's more than one.  Yeah. Can you test it with number?  Result to, set, theory. again  is something. What you see . What you see in your screen. Uh, no, no, no. Maybe there is bug, but. What I see? Uh. OK, return inside you can't be resolved. Mm-hmm. Return integer vwhere is return integer, return this one this. Oh, can't be resolved. It's not working. Maybe this is not working. This is not correct. Let's do this one.  integer this one, this one? Not not right. OK.  You do? What  integer ? You entered as input. OK, this one OK. It should return five. It should return 5.  What is  the problem.  type of expression must be an array type, but it is resolved str string. Where it should be array type.  is it different than mine?  Can you change what you see here?  OK, just click again. Run.  And what you see here is the same as yours. OK. where should be array. Oh, integer parse int. OK. Uh, next time can give me. I.  Here, let's say this 15 yes, 15 yes. I'm getting the one from here. First time. Yes, I'm getting the one. Then this multipation, month multipation. Then this one to one, it's one again. Again this is one. Yes. Second time I'm getting five here and in 1,2,5,5, yes. Str number is string again. This is number I'm converting into string and setting here.  I this is not. This is uh, to get the string given the index and getting the number. Yeah yes these one checking index this one.  Maybe this is not working like that in the Java nokay this work in this way in C#. Uh. Yeah. As. OK, OK. I understand. Maybe it's not working in the Java.  a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe there is as array Java. Uh, if if it's not working like that,  we can change that structure. But new char?  OK, char at Ah OK, maybe not like that. Char at In that. OK, I understand. Like this we should do like this. OK, can you check?  Uh OK OK oh, char at was. Why? But they also and this is converted.  How you can convert it to OK. This will be changed OK. Uh. Character get that value? Something.  One connect.  Can you try?  Why? Where?  29..  OK, what do you see?  It's the same.  Really. No.  this should work like that. But. OK, OK.  OK. And then again here we will need it. OK. OK.  we are going to beginning array.. Want to the beginning of integers or job is to take the delay and find in an index end where the sum of the integer to the left of them. OK, is equal to the sum of integers to the right of them. If. There is no index. That would make this equal to minus one. This one. OK, let's say this is this. Your function will return the index three because at the third position of the array, the sum of the the website of the index one does not and some of the right and index both. Equal. OK. Ah, OK.  yes Uh, we we will get.  Alright, as input you had to find start from here and here you have to sum them in which point, If the will be the same if say, let's say here. These parts, sum of these parts are the same. Some of this part you can index of the four. OK. Uh yeah, let's say oh, your function will return the index one because at the first position of the array. Uh, uh. Oh, this is a bit complex task.  Uh, it's a bit complex. Uh, I mean. you see it here?.  yes. Then two. Minus 49. Again one. Uh, there's a lot of uh. And slow down. Yeah, it's still me.  OK, it gives more more example. OK, that's fine. You are given the area OK at index zero, the left side. In a zero even OK the right side. And minus. They both are equal to Zero then add it. OK, this type, the container and the arrays are equal to zero in this problem. OK England 0 is place where the left side and right side are equal.  this part I also do not understand.  yeah here next zero here 20 how can be equal to the zero?  OK, 40,50,60. Minus 20 yes it means empty array equals to the zero. Hmm. And this part also equals to the zero. That means we have to return index 0. Hmm. Hmm. I do. this part did you understand?.  Yes, this is zero. Yes, calculate them that it will be zero.  Yes, OK. This is index zero, Right part of the index index zero is zero, yes. Hmm. Left part of the index 0. Yes, there is no element  Like right part of the index 0. Yes. Equal to zero if you are. Left part of the Zero is part of.  There is no element.  Here it says If there is no element,then 0 it's. Yeah, OK, yes. That means we have to return return 0.  as a result we have to return exactly that index is right to left.  OK, OK, let's do it. But how do you?  Uh. So let find some solution. I usually write on the paper is easy to.  we can create some methods. But first we have to find some solution. How? How calculate them? OK, maybe we can do like that. Let's say we started from index 0. Uh, current from left side. To the right side to left side you have can calculate this one yes to check if it's equal to left side of the that selected index.   Let's we didn't find it. Then we can move one more and calculate from there to here to then calculate this part oh I understand. Hmm. But I'm sure  We will not finish on time.  it will return int.  Array. What should be our method name. Nice. OK. It accept int array. Let us say numbers. Ok. We need 1/4. Int equal to zero.  and We need one more, one more. Maybe. You know. Numbers should be Here. There. Yeah. Yeah, we are checking. Hmm. OK. I'm starting from right side of array, yes. Hmm. Until Until end of the array? until i. They're not minus, minus. Minus, minus yet. Oh.  OK. And I have to sum them, yes, yes. Right side. You know. Right side. Plus. Number list. Again the same problem I can say like that or not.  Index of this one. I do not know java accept it or not. No.  over there and yes, we can use. Uh, it can you? Give us use if probably. Right. Yes. Umm. Oh. Hmm. Oh, until it will reach, uh, two I selected yes, uh, I'm calculating right. I'll clean this park. Yes. Uh, again, other parts. Left part. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Right, not right. Next time. Next side index. Left side left side. Here it should start from k from 0. Let's see this k from zero, but it will should be smaller than i. Hmm, yes, smaller than I. Uh, I am.  Oh, That it's just a variable you give. Uh we here we have 3-4 loop every time I'm giving the new name I. You can say anything what you want.  And end of the calculator. If. Right side equal to left side. Then return. Yes, in other case. In any other case. You have to return minus 1. OK. No, no. I didn't complete yet. You know. And. Oh. In Java method named lowercase.. Yeah. System out println. You know.  Can you run it?  then I will see. Expected after this tokej. Simple man to complete expression, unresolved completion, segmental error on the token.  I'm not gonna be anything that.  oh okay, I will do like that. Oh. OK. Yes you can test like that.  oh 5 comes, it works. See on your screen. Let's test from here. It will be. Umm. Can you click?  Yeah, it's it's it's working great. OK.
