You and me. uh what is your name Tmusalof USA finals, right? OK. Thank you. as far as I know , uh you are the beginner programmer, right? OK. so, for today, we will be a pair for completing the task. let me share my screen.  OK. so, let's just get started. With uh I am a driver and you can be a navigator, are you OK or you want to be the driver first? OK. let me check it out. I'm not sure. OK. I already encouraged and Live Share. Do you have visual studio code on your computer? OK. cool. so, are you here? no. I have to open the repository first. Actually, I am a programmer, but I forgot about Java at all. Let's get started together. You can also share your screen. And, here is the session. oh. I forgot. Have you installed live share in your with code extension? or actually you can join by browser. but, I think it's maybe difficult to follow to read the code, maybe easier to you if you use on VSCode editor. OK. oh. OK. I saw you. actually, we can check in this editor as well. I cannot see. Let’s create the first file. how to write Java? let's see. we'll see the instructions first. Yeah, we can press on control, shift, and P for Java trips for beginners. So, for quick start, Java entry, create a file, and you can now put the code into a file and press F5 to run in the integrated terminal. OK. firstly, open the terminal and the file. Here. right. actually, we can and uh rename the file as we want. but, there just an instruction. I have a run. OK. if we run debug. OK. let's see how to debug. and, press the breakpoint, and press F5 again. I hope we can debug it. OK. now, we are in this line and we can debug it line by line. OK. it workes. let’s start with the first task. uh,did you access the material? you can also open on your computer and read it. and, we can talk to confirm our understanding together.  ah, I can write it first. OK. the first task is the convert string to camel case from dash and underscore. I think it's just like uh eliminate underscore or dash and change the first character to be the capitalized. but, the problem is why this one is not capitalized. Camel casing, the first character should be. Yeah. I think so. So let's see JAVA ,how to write Java, what's in your mind? what flow we have to do it? for example, first step we have to capitalize. no. first that we have to eliminate dash and underscore. right. OK. let me write a brief steps. eliminate dash and underscore ,right? and the second one is changing the first character. you can also guide me you if you have ideas. hello. are you still with me or do you have any other ideas?  you mean that Java library have the method to change into Camelcase, right? OK. while you are searching, I will try to create a function I wish to. OK. what I just wrote is only replace dash to blank and underscore to blank. and do you have any idea how to convert to camel case? hmm. yeah. oh. you cannot write you have no permission. oh , you have read only. how should I know.  oh. here read only. OK.  This is a shared terminal. why? what happened?  convert. oh, I have an idea like this whenever we found that or we changed next one after that underscore be the capitalized. and I think it's the same as you. would. Oh. yeah, I want to write check the length and here check each character. after that we should convert to capitalize. OK. and then, continue. OK. So, what we have to revise is this one because we have to focus on both dash or underscore. And try to put some text like? OK. and change. OK. let's try. we got this. can you see my terminal?  OK. I input the steal warrior. and this is the same as this. Yeah. cool. And another one is to change this here and see what's happened. the result is Oh here. still here. OK. it's the same. we're good. yeah, we've got it, the first task. The next task, task two. OK. you can try to be the driver. now, I can help. come on. you. here. Yeah. uh it's just the recommendation. It is the rule of the java. we have to uh create the class the name class as the file name. file name. but I'm not sure whether the quick start is not the same name as task 1. but, it's still OK.  hmm. OK.  I just read it persistent bugger like your function.  so, the result is a number of times, right? because the first one is 1* 5, uh 3 * 9, another one is here and here until we reach the only one digit. It takes three times. another one takes two times. and third one is zero time. it’s already one digit. what are you doing you? are trying to create a new function ? uh, let's discuss the step first. you have to. uh OK. so, we have two functions for. the first function is checking that number of digits and another function is splitting the character of each digit and multiply them. OK. that sounds good. Let me change the function name to be check number of digit. so, you have digit to string. I'm not sure. you can. so, this function is your main task that loops for your number, right?  OK. the main task. OK. so, so, I think it should be a while loop instead of for. because we don't know when we will be finished. it’s only checking weather if. whether there is only one character. yeah. it can be changed from this to this. yeah. right. and while for the number of length and greater than one. OK. yes.  the index equal to zero you mean ah the index of the character, right? each character. each digit. uh let me think. uh because it is is the main function maybe integer dot parse int convert digit. no. actually, I think we should have a for inside. sorry I removed your code. OK. maybe index equal to zero and num length and index plus plus i. OK. I got your point. at this time we have to loop for all of characters. we have and convert it 1 by 1.  uh-huh and then let me think.  is that Infinity loop you know? because the number is always greater than one. so we have to.  OK. let’s comment out like this. right. or do you want to? what happened? OK. OK. as you want. Never mind. you've got two. OK. we can comment out. you got two. and we uh loop for every digit and then.  because uh if you see this one 39 is 3 * 9 and do like this until it's changed should be 1 digit. am I wrong? I'm not sure. I try I. I think that.  from me, is the outer loop while loop is cover all of this one. but inner loop is only one it just converts character. and then, put two multiply each other. now, we have to each one of these should be. but it is integer.  yes. number integer number of digits. we can. integer dot to string is.  OK. uh let me see. tell me.  yes. ha ha string and address.  one moment. you maybe have to cast it first. I’m not sure. OK. so, the the result is string, right? oh sorry. oh really?  OK. So what you mean is is while, right? OK. I've got one. And another one we got eight. oh, cool!  oh it looks like we have no need to use for row, right? And just use index like you wrote at the first, equal to zero. OK. cool! and then we have to. we have. yeah. we have. we have to write a for loop inside because we have to multiply each other together. yes. actually, we can.  OK. no. actually we have to return index. no, we have to return the index because the question asked the number of times.  mm-hmm yes. right. right. right. So what we have to return this is the multiplier. yes, multiplier.  so if you say like that. we have to change while loop to an if. am I correct?  if. and, OK. the time is up. I think we can. OK. let's create a task 3. and let’s get started with, the with, the task description. Oh. you already got what the. OK. our flow is can you walk through each array for the each of the element of the array, right? and try to calculate both sides and finish whenever it is equal for the both sides, right?  OK. Uh you didn't put in the function.  I’m just curious that what’s the error is this. And, I’m trying to help. And, input in to the main function. I think this one is incorrect. it should be changed to i, right? because if it's fixed to be one you will start only last.  No problem. That's OK.  I’ve never tried to. OK. so, the number of new is the index divided by 2. Is that correct?  oh OK. cool. yeah. we have to divide by ourselves. if it's equal.  The length is divided by two. uh yes. round down I think yes yeah. Math dot round. floor, because round may be round up.  dot floor return double. we have to and.  yeah. you can put in front of me. And is that OK or not? because of our array length, 12345618. so the length is 8 / 2 is 4. OK. that's fine. oh. that's fine or not? OK. that's fine. because we used a greater than and start by zero. should be 023. OK. cool. and the results, we have to return. we have to return the position that makes two side equal to each other.  position is OK. some if true, we can we can return index. actually, I think it's OK. is OK. to reach the maximum is the number of array divide one by two. but we can stop before right I guess. and I’m not sure that in this programming language write like this or not. we can create something like boolean is equal to false and false. yes. and set is equal to true.  yes. exactly. and we have to return the index, right? the index position. So, we should define the index. no. should define i before going to the loop. and we can return. no, sorry. my fault. we can also break. I think we can return here because it's already found and we can return i. So, we have to traverse and until the mid of the array, right? so then you're right. should be like this. No. in your case uh, we have to traverse until. no actually uh, calculate like this works only when size is the same size. But, what I mean is in our case uh if we have abcde  or the first we should to calculate a and b plus c plus d plus e. not. We go to the first to another group like a plus b and calculate c plus d plus e plus is the same one. Not go further. But, this loop does not have behavior like this. Do you get it? So, we have to first maybe maybe two loops. uh let's try. Never mind. That's OK. Then let me try. you know this.  One moment. Let me try a calculation in a couple minutes. Are you saying you have a problem? if we calculate like I mean some of the array. It means if we go from the left side and the right side at the same pace. Do you know what I mean? a b c d e. but what I understand is like if we start from the left side and calculate for the left side and every time, we calculate the left side calculate all right side or no we have the same.  OK. you we can try your solution first. ok. let’s try. here try let’s put the. OK. I will try. oh what's happened. huh return. oh, you have to return everything and here you may be.  Yes. hey. what happened? OK. come on. It said index out of range. get index range. OK. let's see debug step by step. and we got index 4 for go inside.  four. yes. and then they explore. oh because of we use length. oh should have because this thing is equal to 8 minus zero. minus zero. it's gone. I already. OK. let's see another one, here.  should be equal, should be minus one because the array starts from zero you know what I mean?  yes. what thing you have changed. OK. let’s change to second one. it could be. should be zero, right? Your length should be. OK. cool. you're right. wow we finished! I think it is okay. we almost finished them.
