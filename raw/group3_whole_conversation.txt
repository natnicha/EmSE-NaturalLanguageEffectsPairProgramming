 OK let's start as we decided already. uh you are experienced so let's start first with you. you are the driver and i can read the navigator for this task at least please and then we can see what we can do. OK, let's start from the first task that we have to create  one function. Which convert Unless  this style to this style, remove underscore or dash and make the first letter Uppercase. hmm OK. Hmm. Oh. They gave this information that we will accept this as input or it will be inside.  We should decide each by ourselves or it doesn't matter?  What was your question? because I didn't understand it.  uh, they didn't say this is one will come as input or it will be just. Does a fixed static.  Ah. isn't written there? Complete metafunction converts. And. I think this will be input. Yeah. OK. So we'll be OK.  We can accept any input and output.  And what we will do here we will firstly change to the camel case and secondly we need to remove the underscore here.  Yeah also dash then. OK. Uh, yeah, also there is that ship. Yeah. OK, nice. Let's try one method here. Didn't see.  It will return a string. If it is so in java. Yes. Again we are accepting one input. OK. Now, we should decide. Oh how to search inside the string that we can find if there is any dash or underscore? hmm oh you can search if there is split method because it in c#. We have a split method, I believe we have it in Java also. We can Google. We can use Google and get it. the given regular? OK, it also helps. OK. The stream split mental breaks during. OK, let's try. Input string, Blah blah blah. OK.  here We should have a string array. Uh, we should find which library we should import, because it will not come without importing. Let's see if it will. OK. Oh, it doesn't. Correct. Instead of us yes.  yeah yeah OK. Oh.  What should we import?  We have to find it.  We can try like that. First. Let's say you can't uh, first element of the array. Hmm. We can.  Maybe we need to write inside of class or? Oh, please.  What did what do you have said? Sorry. When you went there. Yeah. And maybe we can write inside. but here should be something important for file also. and then. No. Invoice.  Shouldn't be matter what makes. One shouldn't be matter.  Yeah, and the import file.  Yeah, here. I believe we should import some files here. For example to use string here should be some important files that you can use string Please. This is yet to come. What do you say? Is it allowed to check from eclipse?  Yeah, yeah, everything. Yes. Huh.  How many minutes we have?  We have 8 minutes for this task.  Maybe we. OK.  It's OK. It's OK. Yeah.  Oh. Here it's it's OK, but there. Doesn't.  Wait.  I will Package. For example, we already installed all needed packages. Or we should we can add more packages.  I guess I already did. Oh. Check. Yeah, it's it's already installed.  OK. Hmm. So, uh, let's go step by step.  Maybe we can. Visual studio code java. Here. Install new according package for Java. You know. we need some quick starter. We did it. We didn't. I mean, we can copy from here this grass quick start or could we go?  Who opened this project for us? They they used this product.  No, no, no, no, I didn't. Ah.  maybe we can start from create new project.  Yeah, we can do. Yeah, yeah. We can do the first, OK. Hmm. New, but new. New York. I'm. Yeah.  Maybe because of that I shared this one I need to. And and able to create a folder and I need to check let me check.  OK.  yes. I am sharing.  Yeah, yeah, this is.  What was that?  Uh. I'm putting it back but good. Start from creating new projects and go from there. OK.  why didn't you want to create a new project?  Oh. This is, this might not be your project yet. Uh, actually no.  Uh, we can uh. Here we can create different project like a folder and on the folder file.  Structure should be like that, but project normally then I'm creating new project. Umm. Here I don't know how it's in Java but but in C# under solution you can create a lot of projects like project file extension for example. It can be console projects. Just console will show like this. This is console project for example. Displayed in the console.  Yeah, there. Uh, you know. Uh, here. There is a reason it's yes, and there is some appeared icons, you see. Oh.  Are you managing? Are you? Anything. You know that? The only one. Because I, uh, you couldn't. No, no, I don't like what I'm doing.  No, I'm not doing anything. I'm just saying I'm working your screen. What you share right now with me there are in live share in the on the explorer.  There up to my blog there is life share Workspace live share with bold letters. Here some there is add folder option. One one more quick, one more time. Yeah, yes, here in right folder and file you can new file and new folder. Do you mean I don't mean that one, I didn't mean that one.  Maybe, I mean. see it it's understand that this is Java code Java project. But in our case it didn't understand that this is Java OK. But there you see create our project we should create a project. Under general project we can add Java files.  Hmm. yes and we can open Visual Studio a first page or it should be somewhere here. File, new file, new window, open file and folder. Oh, it's different than Visual Studio. It's different here. Actually I am surprised a bit. Because, um, I without the script.  Can you also send me that link with this quick start Java?  do you see My screen here.  I see yours.  Oh, this new.  Do you see your phone? Anything row?  Oh uh, you can. Is this yours?  This is not mine.  What is it? Oh,  You live there left the live share so you can join with the same week and I think on the check. OK, OK, this is OK. This is because of live share. That's why it's like that. Yes. OK, fine. OK. Actually time is up for this task.  But we couldn't do the environment setting. This is not the one.  We should set environment after that we can start to solve task. Why not? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right, there's an action normally we should have. We have a 20 minute for environment setup.  Why didn't do that you actually assaulted? Maybe you already know it. No, this is almost first time I'm using the Visual Studio. We are you programming with. Studio came. When? And then?  OK then start from beginning. Let's set the environment after that. Hmm.  Did you, uh, try to join again? Uh, you know, after your name is there.  I pressed enter but it does not recognized. Oh. Render the meaning in the same. Meaning. OK. Now it should be here. Yes, that is true. So you should see now.  OK, OK, now let's. Let s understand how to set environment. After that we can.  Gulnar, I want to reload . Let me check. Um, because each time I need to give it access to you. But I couldn't see again you in the room. Yeah. Did you maybe? Uh, let me share.  But you see my screen, yes? Just . Read. You mean?  Let me restart the video go to studio because. this is semi related project given you by the. Teacher.  Or who created this? My blog part. Uh, this is the project we are working together with study. Oh. Yeah. And. We you shared their projectory with me and that we can work together. To turn are you here?  But I don't see your screen anymore.  Yeah, I will again send you. I just reward the Visual Studio good. While I was suspicious about maybe I didn't complete the installation of Java package. So, OK? Oh, I can search for now. Live share. extension.  Can you set this is project? Are you , work together with tALHE?. He is. We are again the same. I put the same purpose.  Yeah, it's just for a business idea, doing this for ourselves. I sent again to link to.  this collaboration station is no longer active. Yeah. OK. Open. Yes. He's. And you drive, right. Again the same problem. Oh. Even.  You couldn't join as young.  Can you try once again?  Is this same link?.  OK, so no I think. Now it should work.  It didn't ask anything for me.  Oh. I don't understand why.  Uh.  Invite participant. Trying to see. Before, at least you were able to join. Now.  No, I I didn't. Let me. Thank you. Something. And before each.  You see me? Yeah, now.  Ah, yes. Make me read right.  could you edit or no?  No. Make. No, yes. Uh, huh. List.  New problem. The public type program must be defined in its own file. Only files. You can add file here. New plan, OK. No.  So as we do setup so lots of our time for task we can do for the next 10 minutes this task.  OK. OK, great. Oh yeah, here it recognize this is java file . This is fine.  Yeah.  I refresh again because package was installed but I didn't reload the Visual Studio code.  OK, great. Thank you. OK. Oh. OK then, no need. This one has funded enough.  Are you? OK. OK, OK. So now you can start to make task? What should we do? And  we can do this. We can work on the first Task, I think. OK, let's do it next 10 minutes.  Now we need main class in Java to test it. Name of the? Thanks. hmm.  This is for testing.  what was named in java. system out print ln  calls are the.  Thanks. Sorry. Yes, now you can. Oh. 3. No. Yeah.  So I see as I remember.  OK. It's going to be OK. . It's OK. OK.  Wait. What happened? . One and one. OK.  We don't. I don't understand. Actually it's installed. Debugger for Java is already installed. Uh, it doesn't even. Right. So I don't really understand.  Yeah, let's click again and do it. OK. Then we should install it, you know.  I see a little bit different. Maybe I'm the host. There is a uninstall button disable. Switch to previous version. Let's use code. Press F5 to. On the code that we need.  it should recognize.  Maybe we should import that file here. Sorry, no.  The name of debugger. What's the name of that package, I think or the one or?  I don't know. The debugger for java extension is not available for web. Oh OK hey, this is not available for web.  So that's why.  You can do it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  What I need to do   justs run this code?  Yes, there is a some bugs.  I don't see your screen, but OK, now I see the bug console. But I don't see those problems. And the problems,  yes, there is. There is a lot of them. Yeah. Can you see? OK, perfect.  You see the output?  output? Yeah. Uh, no. I see no, nothing.  What do you see?  I saw Just problems are. I was thinking that you couldn't see too, that's why.  not applicable argument chart OK, it shouldn't be char. It should be string run it again.  OK. Uh. Yeah, I did. Although. Insert public type my phone must be defined in its own file.  It's own file?.  Maybe we need to import? In own file. Here we have two time public, with public static. Why do we have? Here in the sorting in the wrong part. No, this is here.  Yes. Oh,sorry sorry it is in the wrong part. This is plus. This is not OK.  This one shouldn't be here. This one is a single and this is one more this one. OK. OK. And we. Why it shows this incorrect must be defined in known file.  No. I mean, I mean do you know what I mean? Here in 13 row 13, line 13 there is public static void and again public static void.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here. OK, this is OK. I know the problem with the problem here must be defined n file. OK, let's uh go here. Oh yeah. Add new files.  What it say? Problem is not this one but let s do it.  Oh it for I can't move it and said that scanner class is used to get user input and we need to utilize scanner class import.  Solution. Wait. You also ready? Oh, you couldn't see what I'm writing?  I don't know. I don't see your screen.  Why it is so?  What you write.  Uh, actually, uh, OK, now you see, yes, yes, I think. Before because I was writing. I just can't. Why?  Because of system scanner when we scan anything.  Yeah, we did not scan anything. Yeah. This part OK, yes, yes.  So we have two main. Where is it come from.  Where is the two main?  OK, then you're removing this part.  Can you put from?  Yes, I did. Define is its own.  S. Oh, you see the error?  Yeah, I saw.  You couldn't?  is there 10 problems?  Yes. Yes. Uh, no. Seven. I see seven.  Then this is the old. You can do again?. I close it because.  And what did you say?  Just press run. I want to see what happened.  OK. Yes, I did. What do you see? What you see there is. Two task, one tab on your Visual Studio code. Why?  You. Call mom. There is 8 again the part of type program. OK my. OK. It is in own file What do you mean here? We can search for it. We have written following.  Our time is up, so we can go for other task.  Really. It's because the file name is different from the class name. Uh, is that because of this?  Uh, if I understand correctly, no. We still could not set the environment. So let's let's set it.  Yet still, we didn't. Yeah. Let's take this.  Let's see it. Let's go to another one. OK, we can say that. Second one also will say let's say in. First one. Hmm.  So do you want to write inside one file or with your intention? it shouldn't matter .  can you run this one? Yeah. Sure. Ah, it works. Hmm. Doesn't. But that error was gone.  OK then great, I know what's the problem then OK, we don't need this part. Uh, putting it here? Remove this from here? Hmm. OK. I don't have this one. Removing this one. Inside the it should be. What it's like when I try to remove this part? Hmm. What was happening when you wanted to write? Remove it? That double s every time it double s. Can you run this one?  Yes. Um, for OK, OK, OK, OK, I know what's the problem. OK, task one. OK. Ca you run again? OK, yes one error gone away but still we have three. The import solution cannot be resolved within like this.  What you see. At one.  Who do you see the errors? Or?  I see, Exception insert main. Is it problem part? Yeah. Just one, yeah three. We have a three import solution cannot be resolved.  What's the name of our class here? That's why we need to import task  one no? no we should not,  Oh, can you debug it?  with what with solution? Oh, I mean you here, I don't know how to put breakpoints.  And I already debug  it. OK. Yeah.  What's happened?  I don't see you.  need To click problems on programs or?.  debug part for evaluate session? Um, you started?? Did you put some breakpoint?in which line?.  none of them. in order to debug we have to put breakpoint there. Maybe we need to change it exactly we need to change to next text there first because. OK, OK. OK. So. Function. Transistor. It is positive parameter normal and return is complicated persistent which is among row trying to much more complicated business and now until you reach the single digit. OK. I mean. Because. Hmm. OK. Uh, for this we have to open new file or we we can we can.  I already open the two more fire for other tasks then we can upload.  Oh, OK.  OK, we can. Second one, second one with it said.  Probably. With return int.  What to put the? Persistence forest. What kind of? Yeah, it's says except one input, but in the first task. It didn't say that.  Hmm.  OK. First putting here also one main method to check. You see here it's double again. It puts this one here.  to the task one or  Yeah it was the problem?  Yeah, I I remember that you deleted.  Yeah, I'm getting it from here and putting. Class name is now class two. Class name  should be upper. Yeah. Let's.  You can this result. Actually I already deleted the result and but the problem is when I wrote here. It Happens on your Visual Studio phone so late.  Ah, OK, maybe that's why. Yeah. What did you did? No. Now it's updated.  Yeah, no no you can. I just.  OK, I'm sending number, let s saying this one. This. No, it is int not integer OK. Return. I'm just testing just, uh, can you click the run?  Yes, I did.  Do you see any any unresolved compilation problem in the main? Why there is no problem?  Public type tasks, too, must be defined on its own file.  Oh why? Where you see problem?  Probably, actually I'm checking right now.? So. I do not understand.  Where is freedom static? Static. it was on my Visual Studio like stati.  for me it Is not stati.  In yours I see that it's correct but.  In your in yours it was incorrect. It was incorrect but I incorrect and maybe it will double on your.  So strange. So strange.  So we had to use this live share one share or it's optional?  Actually we have to use.  OK. I didn't like it. Everything looks good in your page. Your screen. Can you test it?  And do you mean would would? Do you wanna from me to test ? run Just run this one because I mock some data, it should return three. I'm just testing it.  It's possible to run this file? If Not possible. No need to continue. We have to set the environment.  I did, actually. I. run it.  Do you want one of from me to run this code?  Yeah, I did.  I did several times.  What you see?  Public type task two must be defined. Five past two must be defined. OK, let's maybe it's because of upper and changing.  OK. Now you can run it  oh, it gone way.  It's OK, you see the input? Is there no problem? You should see Three, in the console I don't see.  You don't see.  Yes, you did. Ah, here we have some error. Said that exception in thread main challenge error unresolved compilation problem. Task two cannot be resolved to a type. Oh, see, I see three.  OK, great. Now we can do that.  Now the setup done here.   OK. OK. OK. OK. Now, we have to think about the solution. Yeah. I'm reading the solution even. I mean task. We need to use loop again. String. um,  I found One solution, but I'm not sure it.  Let us try it Oh. we can convert it to string then say our inputs 375 OK and. Get all the digits. And. Oh. Calculate them. Let's repeat it until the digit is 1. Uh, one digit  is there.  OK.  OK, but this is my solution we can try. I am also not good.  OK. 3. Then. This number.  And value. value okay. 3 value of. And while while Um. Great the number than 1. Then one yes.  Yeah, until.  Yeah, if it's one. Then it will be, yeah, we will return this one back. This one but uh, connecting to int. OK. Uh,string to int in java  clean.  integer parse it? Why you can't see mine? Of course.  Maybe you can use the converter.  value of this one yes.  OK. OK  now. We will check. Uh, let's say this is 325. Hmm. Oh. Str number.  Then you're getting the length. Hmm. Is it in? And. Oh. And. OK. And. for. Yes. Umm. OK, OK. OK. OK. And yes, zero. Yes and 10 equal, yes. Str number. Uh, this one? I'm getting this from here. put  In this inside. Maybe i yes. Uh. Let us do it one. Yeah.  Ten let  me understand 10 is 1. Here.  OK, after all of them, Str number again will be this one. Uh, no, not this one.  Hmm.  Yes. Uh. Of not str. Yeah, this one. Will be 10.  OK.  next. It should work like that. Let's say we accept 325 yes no string  325 because length more than one we entered here. Uh, we get blanks. No need to do this one. You can put it here.  Yes, yes, yes.  Now we said some be OK 1,10th no, we are calculating it's 3. 3. This is 3,3,2,6, yes, 35, yes. Thank you. Then will be 30. Yes. Now our new number is Str number is 13. Yes. And he explained more than one. Yes, it's more than one.  It will do yes OK?  Yeah. Can you test it with number?  Yeah I did. There is some errors.  Result to, set, theory. again  is something. What you see . What you see in your screen. You have you don't have any bug.  Uh, no, no, no. Maybe there is bug, but. What I see? Uh. OK, return inside you can't be resolved. Mm-hmm. Return integer vwhere is return integer, return this one this. Oh, can't be resolved. It's not working. Maybe this is not working. This is not correct. Let's do this one.  OK, OK, OK. integer this one, this one? Not not right. OK.  You do? Yes, I do.  What  integer ? You entered as input. OK, this one OK. It should return five.  Oh.  Who did you? It returned five.  It should return 5.  What is  the problem.  Problem is.  type of expression must be an array type, but it is resolved str string. Where it should be array type.  Here there is in my code like return integer, integer and it return together. I don't see in your screen. is it different than mine?  Yes, it's different from yours.  Can you change what you see here?  Yes yes you do. There Is 1 error is gone away and the secondary type of expression must be an array type, but it resolved to string.  OK, just click again. Run.  Yes, I did.  And what you see here is the same as yours. Let me check from the beginning. String number. And. Yes. Yes, this is and also at the end. can you drop down? Is is this all are the same as I see in your screen  OK. where should be array. Oh, integer parse int. OK. Uh, next time can give me. I.  Um. String number should be array because we. String number we see set as string ? But uh 10? In 13  we said that it's array or what happened, but we changed to it.  Here, let's say this 15 yes, 15 yes. I'm getting the one from here. First time. Yes, I'm getting the one. Hmm.  Then this multipation, month multipation. Then this one to one, it's one again. Again this is one. Yes. Second time I'm getting five here and in 1,2,5,5, yes. Str number is string again. This is number I'm converting into string and setting here.  Yes. I mean for example in the beginning we said that str number is trhree and then inside for loop we rewrite that. Uh, before to change it to integer, we said that it's array string number we. Write I this is not. This is uh, to get the string given the index and getting the number. Yeah yes these one checking index this one.  Yeah, I understand. But uh yeah, I understood that this is the index number I, but here it shows that this especially highlight the str number.  Maybe this is not working like that in the Java nokay this work in this way in C#. Uh. Yeah. As. OK, OK. I understand. Maybe it's not working in the Java.  Hmm. You mean the you cannot write the index number as  a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe there is as array Java. Uh, if if it's not working like that,  we can change that structure. But new char?  is not Work work. Things like this. Good.  OK, char at Ah OK, maybe not like that. Char at In that. OK, I understand. Like this we should do like this. OK, can you check?  Yes. A parse in to string time during this applicable for the agreement. For Char it's not applicable. Parse in string.  Uh OK OK oh, char at was. Why? But they also and this is converted.  uh. do you see char to how we call it.  How you can convert it to OK. This will be changed OK. Uh. Character get that value? Something.  What? value. One connect.  Can you try?  Yes, I can wait. Unreachable code.  Why? Where?  line number 29.  29..  No, it's not the same. Really, really interesting.  OK, what do you see?  I see a number. and. 15 oh now. No it's the same.  It's the same.  And there is a lot of string number cannot be resolved a lot of time strings. String str number turn on the cannot be resolved where it's so. Oh yeah, we need to switch another task. Let's do.  Really. No.  for sure We need to. Let's switch to.  this should work like that. But. Actually, most of the logic of the program is done, but yeah, we need to switch. I think. Unfortunately. Let's do this. Actually we already overtime.  OK, OK.  Because it's not about solving the task, it's about that how we are working together. So that's why,  OK. And then again here we will need it. OK. OK.  it is about arrays.  we are going to beginning array.. Want to the beginning of integers or job is to take the delay and find in an index end where the sum of the integer to the left of them. OK, is equal to the sum of integers to the right of them. If. There is no index. That would make this equal to minus one. This one. OK, let's say this is this. Your function will return the index three because at the third position of the array, the sum of the the website of the index one does not and some of the right and index both. Equal. OK. Ah, OK.  did You got no. yes Uh, we we will get.  Alright, as input you had to find start from here and here you have to sum them in which point, If the will be the same if say, let's say here. These parts, sum of these parts are the same. Some of this part you can index of the four. OK. Uh yeah, let's say oh, your function will return the index one because at the first position of the array. Uh, uh. Oh, this is a bit complex task.  What is it?  Uh, it's a bit complex. Uh, I mean. you see it here?.  es, yes, I see this one one,  yes. Then two. Minus 49. Again one. Uh, there's a lot of uh. And slow down. Yeah, it's still me.  OK, let's go step by step.  OK, it gives more more example. OK, that's fine. You are given the area OK at index zero, the left side. In a zero even OK the right side. And minus. They both are equal to Zero then add it. OK, this type, the container and the arrays are equal to zero in this problem. OK England 0 is place where the left side and right side are equal.  What does it mean? I didn't understand. I this part I also do not understand.  index, 0 is the place where the left. I. And right side  yeah here next zero here 20 how can be equal to the zero?  OK, 40,50,60. Minus 20 yes oh, left side and. Right side are equal. For example, UM, in the third example, minus 80. Uh, yeah, yeah, you're you're you're from the same. Oh, this is minus 10, yes. Uh, this is uh. Minus 70 , -60. Minus 50. Yes. Hmm. I'm 50. I understand. Yes. Yes. Yes, and in next 0. Uh, it says. Uh. Next part of this index zero is empty array. Yes, there is no element inside. Yeah. it means empty array equals to the zero. Hmm. And this part also equals to the zero. That means we have to return index 0. Hmm. Hmm. I do.  It's like my friend.  this part did you understand?.  And actually I didn't understand the OK. The right side is the third one.  Yes, this is zero. Yes, calculate them that it will be zero.  OK. Yeah, yeah, OK.  Yes, OK. This is index zero,  yes, yes.  Right part of the index index zero is zero, yes. Hmm. Left part of the index 0. Yes, there is no element  right part of the. Zero.  What did you say?  Like right part of the index 0. Yes. Equal to zero if you are. Left part of the Zero is part of.  There is no element.  Yes, yes, yes.  Here it says If there is no element,then 0 it's. Yeah, OK, yes. That means we have to return return 0.  OK. OK.  as a result we have to return exactly that index is right to left.  Ohkay. Somehow they look like that. OK, let's do and I will understand.  OK, OK, let's do it. But how do you?  With me even difficult.  Uh. So let find some solution. I usually write on the paper is easy to.  Yes, from what we will start to thinking about.  we can create some methods. But first we have to find some solution. How? How calculate them? I'm going to begin, Array with integer. Minus. 15.  OK, maybe we can do like that. Let's say we started from index 0. Uh, current from left side. To the right side to left side you have can calculate this one yes to check if it's equal to left side of the that selected index.  Hmm.  Let's we didn't find it. Then we can move one more and calculate from there to here to then calculate this part oh I understand. Hmm. But I'm sure  We will not finish on time.  It's the okay.  it will return int.  Array. What should be our method name. Nice. OK. It accept int array. Let us say numbers. Ok. We need 1/4. Int equal to zero.  yes.  and We need one more, one more. Maybe. You know. Numbers should be Here. There. Yeah. Yeah, we are checking. Hmm. OK. I'm starting from right side of array, yes. Hmm. Until Until end of the array? until i. They're not minus, minus. Minus, minus yet. Oh.  OK,  OK. And I have to sum them, yes, yes. Right side. You know. Right side. Plus. Number list. Again the same problem I can say like that or not.  I think you can because I seen some codes that. When they sign, they use. Index of this one. I do not know java accept it or not. No.  There is not such example.  over there and yes, we can use. Uh, it can you? Give us use if probably. Right. Yes. Umm. Oh. Hmm. Oh, until it will reach, uh, two I selected yes, uh, I'm calculating right. I'll clean this park. Yes. Uh, again, other parts. Left part. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Right, not right. Next time. Next side index. Left side left side. Here it should start from k from 0. Let's see this k from zero, but it will should be smaller than i. Hmm, yes, smaller than I. Uh, I am.  Yeah.  What's the K?  Oh, That it's just a variable you give. Uh we here we have 3-4 loop every time I'm giving the new name I. You can say anything what you want.  OK.  And end of the calculator. If. Right side equal to left side. Then return. Yes, in other case. In any other case. You have to return minus 1. OK. No, no. I didn't complete yet. You know. And. Oh. In Java method named lowercase.. Yeah. System out println. You know.  Can you run it?  yes. Oh error. Can you show me the line number 8? Saying set. Quotes. To complete the code. The same. Yes, it's the same. Yeah, one is solved line 14. Line 35 said that. It said, UM, syntax error on token that. At expected after this document. then I will see. Expected after this tokej. Simple man to complete expression, unresolved completion, segmental error on the token.  It shows like line certified, but I'm not sure.  I'm not gonna be anything that.  Do you know what it shows? T.? Calculate equal side of array and underline certified. Can you drop down? T. 10. H oh okay, I will do like that. Oh. OK. Yes you can test like that.  wait I will Do. what it says 5. 5 comes.  oh 5 comes, it works. could you see? No, I don't see it.  See on your screen. Let's test from here. It will be. Umm. Can you click?   comes three.  It should be three. Yeah yes, it's three. Let's this this one also. Uh, this one? OK. Um, one.  Yes, it's good. It should be one.  Yeah, it's it's it's working great. So our time is also up.  OK.
