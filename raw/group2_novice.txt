 Sorry. I didn't get the last statement that was said. can you please.  again quick so.  OK.  OK,  Yes.  Oh, Yeah.  OK.  hey. let's do that.  Yes, of course. no. not you not.  am I supposed to see what you are doing? I am supposed to see what I'm doing over.  Yes. I'm seeing that what you are typing. yeah, I'm seeing what you're typing. OK. just a minute.  Did you see what I typed? I can see what you type. OK.  OK. That sounds understandable. I think I'm just really really getting to understand you.  yeah. but I I had it to be a bit hard a bit tough. What do you think ? no, I did not I did not. start I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript . yeah. yeah, yeah.  OK. great.  OK. training we're here for the time being. I think it just so what I type on, and delete it.  it just. yes. oh beautiful. so I just creating a string for the first task.  OK. you go on. OK. OK. it's getting clear. oh. OK. How can I get in pieces, one way most of the work?  That operation is not the piece that you are doing most of the work. yeah.  yeah, sure. sure.  yeah.  yes.  You are trying to finding underscore on your keyword.  OK.  do you intend putting underscore here or dash with that?  OK. great.  oh. at least, I can help to check Google I think that's allowed. OK. Good. keep going while I am checking . I would just be swipe, but it's looking a bit advanced.  oh, I'm so much work guys.  I think I'm not I'm not allowed to paste. I'm just pasting on the chats.  I'm not sure, so.  it is from a trusted site which is just use that as a subsidiary like.  yeah. I understand yeah they all is different type. you good on this, right ?  is a way you save that or you probably?  yeah you too. you are literally helpful. you're really really helpful. if it were left to me, I would really be confused. Assistance Bugger. A type of function persistence that takes in a positive parameter known and returns its multiplicative assistance which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in number until you reach a single digit, for example, inputs is greater than output has nine is greater than three because 3 * 9 = 27, 2 *7 = 14, 1 * 4 questions for 14K only one you have. OK. yeah, that's that's scope for it. you feel we should greet within task one.  yeah. Now, the least is task 2.  OK. great.  you've been able to come up with anything.  OK. I'm also trying to check online and see but getting.  and your favorite things. oh I was looking at text too. I haven't. you already got something on text 1. oh I sorry. OK. following uh.  OK. great. so it's.  if you, think so.  well, you already use one i greater than then normal lengths.  yeah. yeah. yes. yeah. yes. I understand.  OK. OK. OK. so, what I sent that.  yes. Sorry. I sent something yeah on the google not really trusted.  yeah. yeah. alright.  sometimes you write a code takes so long and when you just see someone professional writing it very short and simple and. oh OK OK. so you just comment turns the one we want to the comments and use this. OK. it's cool. that's cool. it’s just that we can we can go on are and see how responsive it is or if there are any errors, but I think there shouldn't be any error.  I think they need more function that you committed. I will just advance. So. alright. great.  OK. one try. you want to try using an online compiler to run it and see?  OK. if we have time, you can just try that. we just try that. let's see how are responsive that will be learn everyday yeah.  compilation error? didn't just think that's because we're having two different task being from the same time.  just  is it showing any red lines to tell us where the error might be. would you just add the rest of the code the one I sent to the charts and see if. ah I can't see yet. I am scrolling through.  is it in this isn't the zoom chat or right here in VSCode? oh, so sorry, I can’t still see. But, no problem. no worries. no worries. got you got it you got it. So, what do you suggest we do? should we stand by the the one you turned into comments? What do you feel? are you are you with me?  still not working? let's let's just try and modify the one you wrote and see if.  OK. understood. we have the error from the first one. is that what you're trying to say. OK. OK. I see. this time this is good training.  yeah. it's going cool! it's going cool! it's little stress, no no work hustle and bustle. So, it’s really do it yet. I was disconnected for a few seconds. very sorry about that. I think. OK. so, it sounds a bit tougher. We have 25 minutes for this any idea. so it's gonna be really tough.  just one minute.  as I get to my airpods. OK. let us trying to figure out any idea or maybe get some. let's try really understand question and check. And yeah just trying to start through some things too. I'm thinking too. but now alright dictate this to something challenging.  it's good. it's good timing.  you found an answer?  OK. Cool! that's good.  Are you trying to compile this one?  OK. good. can you send on chat? I'm still trying to understand. Understand and analyze it.  oh in Javascript, not in Java.  What’s an idea? there's a lot. the array dot slice, dot reduce that would use think that's really really the major look clear one. if you could just check your the base, I could just really without convert. if we are going convert then it’s going to be, it’s hard. this was possible. How have you got? Java? you don't understand it it's looking advanced?  it’s sorting already.  I will pull this source of works. so we're going to be. very slow. did you to come up with something? OK.  yeah.  so we still have time? I'm trying to join the live share  working for Google. OK. OK. OK. so you're saying that must have a lot of written functions.  OK. OK. You got it. at least one or two should work out of the three.  it's not bad for you. Yeah. this week we could get feedback on which one works or which one doesn't work. just to me put on just one people you need to. We actually almost done.
