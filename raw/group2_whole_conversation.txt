 Sorry. I didn't get the last statement that was said. can you please.  yeah. sure. so so in the presentation the link we got uh the host was saying that we can actually install a extension of Visual Studio Code which allows us to share our codes with our friends or partners so the name of the extension is live share I've already downloaded it in my Google. uh you know Visual Studio code. again quick so.  I think you you just need to you know go through the presentation yeah you know slides.  OK.  B. and and you get a basic understanding of how we are going to do this.  OK, just a few minutes.  yeah. sure. I'm also going through the presentation right now. Yes. can you can you see me yet.  yeah, OK. great. just one second while trying.  Oh, Yeah.  so we are done with our setup right now we need to focus on the tasks.  OK.  so just comment says convert string to camelcase.  hey. let's do that.  yeah. sure. complete the method or function so that it converts dash or underscore deliminated words to come some first word within that should be capitalized only personal word scandalized known as upcoming case first word within the output we get with the works only if the original next skip. OK. and we approached this.  Yes, of course. ohh, i sorry? no. not you not.  OK. this will be one string that will be coming into our function.  am I supposed to see what you are doing? I am supposed to see what I'm doing over.  Oh. yeah, yeah yeah, we are in the Visual Studio code. I'm supposed to see what you're writing and you were supposed to see what I'm writing. waits. can you see by the way my? Yes. I'm seeing that what you are typing. yeah, I'm seeing what you're typing. OK. can you can you type something? OK. just a minute.  yeah. sure.  Did you see what I typed? uh no. I I I just saw your marker moved power. I think uh yeah yeah. it doesn't matter. no problem. I am going to start. and as you can see me. I think there's no problem that. I can see what you type. OK. oh, you must be very good at Java. my first language was actually Java but I haven't practiced it since a long time.  OK. That sounds understandable. I think I'm just really really getting to understand you.  OK. um it's a great language that. yeah. but I I had it to be a bit hard a bit tough. What do you think ? you started with sorry? you started with C++? no, I did not I did not. start I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript . yeah, yeah, that's that's good too that's actually HTML CSS the JavaScript  yeah. those are the languages of Internet, right?  yeah, yeah. OK. I see what you got here, public static, void, main, string, Args.  yeah, right. so this is basically the basic template to start a Java program.  OK. great.  we need to create a method that can take a string.  OK. training we're here for the time being. I think it just so what I type on, and delete it.  uh yeah. now I can see what you're typing. it just. yes. oh beautiful. so I just creating a string for the first task.  yeah. no, just uh I just created a template string so that I can work with it in in the method that I'm going to write.  OK. you go on. OK. OK. it's getting clear. oh. OK. now we need to do is this is an array of strings as input. How can I get in pieces, one way most of the work?  I'm sorry. I’m not understand. That operation is not the piece that you are doing most of the work. yeah, no problem. it's just I'm just thinking and.  yeah.  I can I'm not 100% sure if I'm doing it right. you you you help me,  yeah, sure. sure.  what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to look through the string that I took uh one by one as in Java you know the string is already. I think in most of the languages the string is already an array.  yeah.  so it is it is easy to iterate over over the array through a loop.  yes.  so that's what I'm doing and I'm trying to find a delimiter which is the dash the underscore and and the dash underscore.  You are trying to finding underscore on your keyword.  you're right. this this dash and underscore those are the delimiters.  OK.  Ok, two dash or.  do you intend putting underscore here or dash with that?  uh that's a dash and the next one is going to be underscore. we need to have equals. yes. So what I'm checking here is if I get an underscore or a dash within my string. I am going to change something within this string. OK. great.  so if I get a dash then the next letter will be changed to uppercase. how to change to uppercase in Java? I think we are going to lose so much time. we have only 15 minutes for this task. oh. at least, I can help to check Google I think that's allowed. yeah. yeah. yeah.  OK. Good. keep going while I am checking . yeah. thank you. yeah.  I would just be swipe, but it's looking a bit advanced.  yeah sure.  oh, I'm so much work guys.  I think I'm not I'm not allowed to paste. sorry?  I'm just pasting on the chats.  uh, I am not sure though. is it working? I'm not sure, so.  OK. it is from a trusted site which is just use that as a subsidiary like.  yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure. I think yeah that that that makes sense to certain extent but I am not that familiar with that array or string method. yeah. I understand yeah they all is different type. yeah. OK. I think we need to move to the next task. I'm this is you you. you good on this, right ?  I think it will work, I'm not able to run it for whatever reason.  is a way you save that or you probably?  yeah it will stay save. I think I can just create another file this.  yeah you too. you are literally helpful. you're really really helpful. if it were left to me, I would really be confused. so yeah. this is task two is saying.  Assistance Bugger. A type of function persistence that takes in a positive parameter known and returns its multiplicative assistance which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in number until you reach a single digit, for example, inputs is greater than output has nine is greater than three because 3 * 9 = 27, 2 *7 = 14, 1 * 4 questions for 14K only one you have. to keep multiplying and.  OK. OK. go ahead save. to keep multiplying until we get a single digit number.  yeah, that's that's scope for it. has 15 minutes and we need to write a function persistence. you know we don't need another another task tutor, so we can create within this.  you feel we should greet within task one.  yeah yeah. yeah. Now, the least is task 2.  Yeah. within the same class just outside of the main method.  OK. great.  it is great to see return a number put the giant persistence repairs.  you've been able to come up with anything.  Nope I'm trying to.  OK. I'm also trying to check online and see but getting.  in there every number, we can turn it into a string and string is an array then we can turn it back into numbers is there any easier way? and your favorite things. oh I was looking at text too. I haven't. you already got something on text 1. oh I sorry. OK. following uh.  yeah. I'm trying to you know convert the text number the receive number. we received into the function through a text. so, then we then we can loop over every single digit or what we could have done is we could have you know module used the modulus to separate out the digits, but that is a different way. we can try.  OK. great. so it's.  if I go zero, then the first and the second string will get. uh it doesn't make sense too.  if you, think so.  I don't think it makes sense because when the the i will be 0, the number the first is it and the second is it will get multiplied. but when the i will be one, then the 2nd and the 3rd digit will be multiplied.  well, you already use one i greater than then normal lengths.  oh, this is this is no problem because this is a local variable. yeah. yeah. yes. yeah. yes. I understand.  this will only work if we give it the only two two digit numbers.  OK. OK. OK. to use Google actually. OK. so, what I sent that.  uh did you send anything? yes. Sorry. I sent something yeah on the google not really trusted.  but the first the first part makes sense. it is singling out the digits uh static and dig some. no problem. to test that oh wow that's really simple. interesting.  yeah. yeah. alright.  I am going to comment out this code and.  sometimes you write a code takes so long and when you just see someone professional writing it very short and simple and. yeah and really it is it is understandable. driver runs. oh OK OK. so you just comment turns the one we want to the comments and use this. OK. it's cool. that's cool. it’s just that we can we can go on are and see how responsive it is or if there are any errors, but I think there shouldn't be any error.  Yeah. hopefully. I'm asking to leave this one. I think they need more function that you committed. I will just advance. So. yeah, I'm just going to take it out of the main function. so that it doesn't run every time. I run the main function. alright. great. this I just sent you the rest of the code it wasn't complete.  OK. OK. yeah. got it. no problem. I, you know, there is a way we can check actually this one, but we need to go to an online compiler.  OK. one try. you want to try using an online compiler to run it and see?  and yeah. yeah. that that thing.  OK. if we have time, you can just try that. we just try that. let's see how are responsive that will be learn everyday yeah.  it is giving us a compilation error.  compilation error? didn't just think that's because we're having two different task being from the same time.  uh, no. it's actually a single class. and I don't think it should be a problem, but it is saying that a parenthesis.  just  OK. OK. OK. is it showing any red lines to tell us where the error might be. would you just add the rest of the code the one I sent to the charts and see if. yeah, I think I. yeah I've added it to the uh solution already you can see in the main section. the one you wrote it is I'm I've highlighted the section. can you see it ?  ah I can't see yet. I am scrolling through.  um, it's I've highlighted it. can you see it now?  is it in this isn't the zoom chat or right here in VSCode? in VSCode. oh, so sorry, I can’t still see. But, no problem. no worries. no worries. got you got it you got it. So, what do you suggest we do? should we stand by the the one you turned into comments? What do you feel? are you are you with me?  yeah. yeah. i am trying to run this program, but it is not working.  still not working? nope. let's let's just try and modify the one you wrote and see if.  no. I don't think because of of the second. uh problem we wrote. I think it's because of the first one, but the one that we did. and we I we were confident that this kind of work, camel cases.  OK. understood. we have the error from the first one. is that what you're trying to say. yeah, right. right.  OK. OK. I see. this time this is good training. Sorry, I just been having terrible cough. yeah. but the the weather has become really nice for the past couple of days.  yeah. how was your new year, by the way? it's going cool! it's going cool! it's little stress, no no work hustle and bustle. So, it’s really do it yet. alright. so I think I don't see any problem. so the third task is equal sides of an array.  I was disconnected for a few seconds. very sorry about that. I think. No problem. task time for second one is over. So, move to the next third task. OK. so, it sounds a bit tougher. We have 25 minutes for this any idea. yet Nope and. so it's gonna be really tough.  yeah I think it is one of those sorting problems.  just one minute.  sure. as I get to my airpods. so, we have been given an array debt the number the left digits and the right digits should be equal to the same number. it something like that. How we can look over the array from the forward side and the backward side? and that's from iterative program, we can.  OK. let us trying to figure out any idea or maybe get some. let's try really understand question and check. And yeah just trying to start through some things too. yeah. I'm just thinking how can we approach this problem.  I'm thinking too. but now alright dictate this to something challenging.  yeah.  it's good. it's good timing.  and all those found an answer for this problem.  you found an answer?  yeah. on online, on GitHub. OK. Cool! that's good.  alright. How is it working?  Are you trying to compile this one?  yeah. I'm I'm trying to, you know internalize this? how is this working? I can provide you the answer and you can also take a look at it and see how is it working.  OK. good. can you send on chat? yeah.  I'm still trying to understand. yeah. Understand and analyze it.  The problem here is the code is written in JavaScript and we need to have it in Java.  oh in Javascript, not in Java.  right.  What’s an idea? I can convert. but I'm not sure that array dot slice and array dot reduce methods exist in Java.  there's a lot. the array dot slice, dot reduce that would use think that's really really the major look clear one. in Java as well.  if you could just check your the base, I could just really without convert. if we are going convert then it’s going to be, it’s hard. this was possible. How have you got? I've got another solution in Java. but I don't understand this either.  Java? you don't understand it it's looking advanced?  yeah. array copy that’s something a built-in function, I think. array copy, what’s array copy. It’s a special position, scope. it’s sorting already.  destination position, and round for. I will pull this source of works. so we're going to be. very slow. did you to come up with something? yeah. he somehow managed to understand the problem that, uh, you know the solution that we found. so basically array copy is a built-in function and it takes the and you know source array the destination and the array the new array that it is going to produce and the destination all those sort of things. so and and they're approaching it just like I was telling you that they're approaching it from the one side forward side of the array and the backward side of the area and they're trying to match you know those those elements and see when the sum of those elements are equal to one another.  OK.  that's when they generate the results I think. yeah. yeah. we still have time, right? I'm sorry?  so we still have time? uh yeah maybe three or 4 minutes. I'm trying to join the live share  Yeah. Sure.  working for Google. OK. OK. OK. so you're saying that must have a lot of written functions.  yeah. yeah.  OK. OK. You got it. at least one or two should work out of the three.  yeah. I'm really upset.  it's not bad for you. Yeah. this week we could get feedback on which one works or which one doesn't work. just to me put on just one people you need to. let's change it into an array. We actually almost done.
