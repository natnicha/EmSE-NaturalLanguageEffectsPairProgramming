 You and me. uh what is your name Tmusalof USA finals, right? OK. Thank you. as far as I know , uh you are the beginner programmer, right? OK. so, for today, we will be a pair for completing the task. let me share my screen.  OK. so, let's just get started. With uh I am a driver and you can be a navigator, are you OK or you want to be the driver first? OK. let me check it out. I'm not sure. OK. I already encouraged and Live Share. Do you have visual studio code on your computer? OK. cool. so, are you here? no. I have to open the repository first. Actually, I am a programmer, but I forgot about Java at all. Let's get started together. You can also share your screen. And, here is the session. oh. I forgot. Have you installed live share in your with code extension? or actually you can join by browser. but, I think it's maybe difficult to follow to read the code, maybe easier to you if you use on VSCode editor. OK. oh. OK. I saw you. actually, we can check in this editor as well. I cannot see. Let’s create the first file. how to write Java? let's see. we'll see the instructions first. Yeah, we can press on control, shift, and P for Java trips for beginners. So, for quick start, Java entry, create a file, and you can now put the code into a file and press F5 to run in the integrated terminal. OK. firstly, open the terminal and the file. You still have to rename it. You also need to rename the java file. I have a run. OK. if we run debug. OK. let's see how to debug. and, press the breakpoint, and press F5 again. I hope we can debug it. OK. now, we are in this line and we can debug it line by line. OK. it workes. let’s start with the first task. uh,did you access the material? you can also open on your computer and read it. and, we can talk to confirm our understanding together.  ah, I can write it first. OK. the first task is the convert string to camel case from dash and underscore. I think it's just like uh eliminate underscore or dash and change the first character to be the capitalized. but, the problem is why this one is not capitalized. Camel casing, the first character should be.  the first character should be the capital letter.  So let's see JAVA ,how to write Java, what's in your mind? what flow we have to do it? for example, first step we have to capitalize. no. first that we have to eliminate dash and underscore. right. OK. let me write a brief steps. eliminate dash and underscore ,right? and the second one is changing the first character. you can also guide me you if you have ideas. hello. are you still with me or do you have any other ideas?  you mean that Java library have the method to change into Camelcase, right? OK. while you are searching, I will try to create a function I wish to. OK. what I just wrote is only replace dash to blank and underscore to blank. and do you have any idea how to convert to camel case? hmm. yeah. oh. you cannot write you have no permission. oh , you have read only. how should I know.  oh. here read only. OK.  This is a shared terminal. why? what happened?  convert. oh, I have an idea like this whenever we found that or we changed next one after that underscore be the capitalized. and I think it's the same as you. would. Oh. yeah, I want to write check the length and here check each character. after that we should convert to capitalize. OK. and then, continue. OK. So, what we have to revise is this one because we have to focus on both dash or underscore. And try to put some text like? OK. and change. OK. let's try. we got this. can you see my terminal?  OK. I input the steal warrior. and this is the same as this. Yeah. cool. And another one is to change this here and see what's happened. the result is Oh here. still here. OK. it's the same. we're good. yeah, we've got it, the first task. The next task, task two. OK. you can try to be the driver. now, I can help. come on. you. here. I have to do the second part? OK. Let me read.  I didn't understand the task.  I mean. I mean the task description I don't understand like what does it come from us on the second task. Ah. so, I understand.  so, the result is a number of times, right? because the first one is 1* 5, uh 3 * 9, another one is here and here until we reach the only one digit. It takes three times. another one takes two times. and third one is zero time. it’s already one digit. what are you doing you? are trying to create a new function ? uh, let's discuss the step first. you have to. the idea is to convert digit to string first to then check its length. if it's more than one, then we need to continue the process. so, we will check the the length of that and within the of each item of the array. I mean, the character of the string. then, convert it to integer again. then, multiplied by it. then, uh do it again and again until we reached the single digit. does it a sound good?   I'm sorry Uh. so, this function is your main task that loops for your number, right?  let’s write all of them here. so, we can cut it. and then, put it in the second method.  whether there is only one character. yeah. it can be changed from this to this. yeah. right. and while for the number of length and greater than one. OK. um then we also need int, right?  and then um.  uh yes. do we have to integer function or to convert to integer ? Oh yeah.  I think we did something wrong in here. yeah. or we didn't? can we just do a just test it here? I'm not sure if it is well no not for example.  uh no. I just want to test this one. and how to run this ? I just want to and  they can just like.  or do you want to? what happened? then then, try to I want to get what's the result for this. I'm not sure.  OK. OK. OK. OK. sorry. why do you write a for within the loop within the while? why?  I have another idea for that. actually, without a while loop. but it's OK. no problem.  it is num, isn’t it?  can I try this one. can you run this?  how about this one? can you run it again?  you maybe have to cast it first. I’m not sure. should be string instead of array I think.  yes. that should be array string and then while loop and then move.  It just oh remove this one and remove this one and then digit parse int.  ahha. And just use index like you wrote at the first, equal to zero. OK. cool! and then we have to. we have. yeah. we have. we have to write a for loop inside because we have to multiply each other together. yes. actually, we can.  OK. no. actually we have to return index. no, we have to return the index because the question asked the number of times.  mm-hmm yes. right. right. right. So what we have to return this is the multiplier. yes, multiplier.  so if you say like that. we have to change while loop to an if. am I correct?  if. and, OK. the time is up. I think we can. OK. let's create a task 3. and let’s get started with, the with, the task description. I found something like this. does work in my locals working. So then, no worries. OK. boolean. OK. our flow is can you walk through each array for the each of the element of the array, right? and try to calculate both sides and finish whenever it is equal for the both sides, right?  OK. Uh you didn't put in the function.  I’m just curious that what’s the error is this. And, I’m trying to help. And, input in to the main function. I think this one is incorrect. it should be changed to i, right? because if it's fixed to be one you will start only last.  No problem. That's OK.  I’ve never tried to. OK. so, the number of new is the index divided by 2. Is that correct?  oh OK. cool. uh my logic is completely wrong. Yes. you are right. and if it is another function then.  and then should be math dot around or something like this.  It should be floor. Yes. OK. Is that correct? Array dot length. It has never used. OK uh if it return double OK Umm sorry. double. index. you are right. yeah. you can put in front of me. is it good? digits, we send the index here. Then, what we are checksum. oh OK. return a position. I think we have died from the game. so we don't, we don't need to calculate. we don't, we don't need. we need to divide by two. we first need to go to with the.  uh I think we can do something like this. if is equal to.  and we need to break from the loop function.  what is the next one? for example what if like this 1 1 is equal. and then 3 3 is equal. but all 6 6  is also equal. but in our case, if do not calculate the one because it will say that OK. it is fine, then it will break. I have one more idea. I can run down. you can continue there. afterwards, check Umm.  I but what. if but after the first iteration if you stop that station. you know what I mean? so, let's say that index is one and the i is one. and then, we get the first element and the last element, right? And then, some first will be one, some last will be one. Then, if you check if equal then break or return index to stop. It will not go further this. It could be.   I think I have an idea again.  So, we can sum first equal to sum last. Then is equal equal to true. OK.  OK. and then it came here the next step.  else if sum fist is not equal sum last and is equal equal to true return i minus one.  If not equal, otherwise, continue. What about this one? We are the same also dropdown. this array length minus one is the last item. So, in the first iteration, we get one from the first. And then we get one from the last. And then we add the first one to here and the last one to here. and then compare it. if it is equal to the is equal to true and then in the next step. for example. for example, it is now 2, and then it will continue at true here and add another one from the last second to here. both of them sum first sum it again 3 is equal. so it equal to true again, it can continues until it's exact equal. and if it is not equal, and then the previous value of this equal. it’s also true so. that means the previous iteration was correct. and there is another step after that. So, then it should to return that index minus one. I think, maybe we can just try check them out.  yeah then if it doesn't work, then we can continue with yours.  we have the double index instead what we have trying, not it does it.  OK. now, can you run? I hope it will work. OK. now let's continue with yours. index four? Ok. why zero minus i.  where is the debugger right now.  OK just go one step forward. should be one then.  yes. OK. yeah that's fine. OK. just really, so it's true. but should not be true, can you run again.  what thing you have changed. OK. let’s change to second one. it could be. should be zero, right? Your length should be. OK. cool. you're right. wow we finished! I think it is okay. we almost finished them.
