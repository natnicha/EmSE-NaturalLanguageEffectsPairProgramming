 You and me. uh what is your name Tmusalof USA finals, right? Taleh hi I'm sending on the chat.  OK. Thank you. as far as I know , uh you are the beginner programmer, right? yes.  OK. so, for today, we will be a pair for completing the task. let me share my screen.  OK. oh.  OK. so, let's just get started. With uh I am a driver and you can be a navigator, are you OK or you want to be the driver first? How you wish. doesn't matter.  OK. let me check it out. I'm not sure. OK. I already encouraged and Live Share. Do you have visual studio code on your computer? yes.  OK. cool. so, are you here? no. I have to open the repository first. Actually, I am a programmer, but I forgot about Java at all. Let's get started together. You can also share your screen. And, here is the session. oh. I forgot. Have you installed live share in your with code extension? or actually you can join by browser. but, I think it's maybe difficult to follow to read the code, maybe easier to you if you use on VSCode editor. I opened it. OK. oh. OK. I saw you. actually, we can check in this editor as well. I cannot see. Let’s create the first file. how to write Java? let's see. we'll see the instructions first. Yeah, we can press on control, shift, and P for Java trips for beginners. So, for quick start, Java entry, create a file, and you can now put the code into a file and press F5 to run in the integrated terminal. OK. firstly, open the terminal and the file. You still have to rename it. You also need to rename the java file. Here. right. actually, we can and uh rename the file as we want. but, there just an instruction. I have a run. OK. if we run debug. OK. let's see how to debug. and, press the breakpoint, and press F5 again. I hope we can debug it. OK. now, we are in this line and we can debug it line by line. OK. it workes. let’s start with the first task. uh,did you access the material? you can also open on your computer and read it. and, we can talk to confirm our understanding together.  yes. sure, So, you will write or you will write. ah, I can write it first. OK. the first task is the convert string to camel case from dash and underscore. I think it's just like uh eliminate underscore or dash and change the first character to be the capitalized. but, the problem is why this one is not capitalized. Camel casing, the first character should be.  the first character should be the capital letter.  Yeah. I think so. So let's see JAVA ,how to write Java, what's in your mind? what flow we have to do it? for example, first step we have to capitalize. no. first that we have to eliminate dash and underscore. right. OK. let me write a brief steps. eliminate dash and underscore ,right? and the second one is changing the first character. you can also guide me you if you have ideas. hello. are you still with me or do you have any other ideas? I was checking on the Google that if there has a specific method for that.  you mean that Java library have the method to change into Camelcase, right?  yes.  OK. while you are searching, I will try to create a function I wish to. I search from google or somewhere. OK. what I just wrote is only replace dash to blank and underscore to blank. and do you have any idea how to convert to camel case? yeah. I have found the function for that. hmm. should I copy paste there ? yeah. I cannot.  oh. you cannot write you have no permission. oh , you have read only. how should I know.  maybe if you click on the read only. maybe you can change it to write access.  oh. here read only. OK.  I still cannot.  This is a shared terminal. why? what happened?  now, we can use. OK. sorry, I think that is my bad. I was watching from the zoom. I thought that is the same screen. convert. oh, I have an idea like this whenever we found that or we changed next one after that underscore be the capitalized. and I think it's the same as you. would. Oh. yeah, I want to write check the length and here check each character. after that we should convert to capitalize. OK. and then, continue. OK. So, what we have to revise is this one because we have to focus on both dash or underscore. And try to put some text like? OK. and change. OK. let's try. we got this. can you see my terminal?  mm-hmm OK. I input the steal warrior. and this is the same as this. Yeah. cool. And another one is to change this here and see what's happened. the result is Oh here. still here. OK. it's the same. we're good. yeah, we've got it, the first task. The next task, task two. OK. you can try to be the driver. now, I can help. come on. you. here. I have to do the second part? Yeah. OK. Let me read.  I didn't understand the task.  uh it's just the recommendation. It is the rule of the java. we have to uh create the class the name class as the file name. file name. but I'm not sure whether the quick start is not the same name as task 1. but, it's still OK. I mean. I mean the task description I don't understand like what does it come from us on the second task.  hmm. OK.  I just read it persistent bugger like your function.  Ah. so, I understand.  so, the result is a number of times, right? because the first one is 1* 5, uh 3 * 9, another one is here and here until we reach the only one digit. It takes three times. another one takes two times. and third one is zero time. it’s already one digit. what are you doing you? are trying to create a new function ? yeah. and. uh and.  uh, let's discuss the step first. you have to. the idea is to convert digit to string first to then check its length. if it's more than one, then we need to continue the process. so, we will check the the length of that and within the of each item of the array. I mean, the character of the string. then, convert it to integer again. then, multiplied by it. then, uh do it again and again until we reached the single digit. does it a sound good?  uh OK. so, we have two functions for. the first function is checking that number of digits and another function is splitting the character of each digit and multiply them. OK. that sounds good. Let me change the function name to be check number of digit. so, you have digit to string. I'm not sure. you can.  I'm sorry Uh. so, this function is your main task that loops for your number, right?  yes. OK. the main task. let’s write all of them here. so, we can cut it. and then, put it in the second method.  OK. so, so, I think it should be a while loop instead of for. because we don't know when we will be finished. it’s only checking weather if. you’re right. yeah.  whether there is only one character. yeah. it can be changed from this to this. yeah. right. and while for the number of length and greater than one. OK. um then we also need int, right?  yes.  and then um.  the index equal to zero you mean ah the index of the character, right? each character. each digit. uh yes. do we have to integer function or to convert to integer ? uh let me think. uh because it is is the main function maybe integer dot parse int convert digit. Oh yeah.  no. actually, I think we should have a for inside. sorry I removed your code. OK. maybe index equal to zero and num length and index plus plus i. OK. I got your point. at this time we have to loop for all of characters. we have and convert it 1 by 1.  I think we did something wrong in here. yeah. or we didn't? can we just do a just test it here? I'm not sure if it is well no not for example.  uh-huh and then let me think.  uh no. I just want to test this one. and how to run this ? is that Infinity loop you know? because the number is always greater than one. so we have to.  I just want to and  they can just like.  OK. let’s comment out like this. right. or do you want to? what happened? I just. sorry. maybe make this one. then then, try to I want to get what's the result for this. I'm not sure.  OK. OK. as you want. OK. OK. OK. OK. sorry. Never mind. you've got two. OK. we can comment out. you got two. and we uh loop for every digit and then.  why do you write a for within the loop within the while? why?  because uh if you see this one 39 is 3 * 9 and do like this until it's changed should be 1 digit. am I wrong? I'm not sure. I try I. I think that. I have another idea for that. actually, without a while loop. but it's OK. no problem.   from me, is the outer loop while loop is cover all of this one. but inner loop is only one it just converts character. and then, put two multiply each other. now, we have to each one of these should be. but it is integer.  it is num, isn’t it?  yes. number integer number of digits. we can. integer dot to string is.  can I try this one. OK. uh let me see. tell me.  can you run this?  yes. ha ha string and address.  how about this one? can you run it again?  one moment. you maybe have to cast it first. I’m not sure. OK. then we need do it again.  OK. so, the the result is string, right? oh sorry. ah that's my bad. I understand that what is the issue again. should be string instead of array I think.  oh really?  yes. that should be array string and then while loop and then move.  OK. So what you mean is is while, right? OK. I've got one. And another one we got eight. oh, cool!  It just oh remove this one and remove this one and then digit parse int.  oh it looks like we have no need to use for row, right? ahha. And just use index like you wrote at the first, equal to zero. OK. cool! and then we have to. we have. yeah. we have. we have to write a for loop inside because we have to multiply each other together.  we can do maybe something like this, int while equal to one. then, can we do something like this.  yes. actually, we can.  and then after a while, then the time.  OK. no. actually we have to return index. no, we have to return the index because the question asked the number of times.  uh because we need to run this function again and then because we need to convert this multiplier into string again and then check if  it’s more than one blah blah. than should go like this? I mean in the example. so is the multiply by 27, right? and then result is convert to the to string again. is I'm right?  mm-hmm yes. right. right. right. So what we have to return this is the multiplier. yes, multiplier.  R but if it is bigger than one time one not. so that one goes like this. and then Umm just give.  so if you say like that. we have to change while loop to an if. am I correct?  uh.  if. and, OK. the time is up. I think we can. OK. let's create a task 3. and let’s get started with, the with, the task description. I found something like this. Oh. you already got what the. does work in my locals working. So then, no worries. OK. boolean. OK. our flow is can you walk through each array for the each of the element of the array, right? and try to calculate both sides and finish whenever it is equal for the both sides, right?  yes.  OK. Uh you didn't put in the function.  yes. that's why I'm writing in. I’m just curious that what’s the error is this. And, I’m trying to help. And, input in to the main function. I think this one is incorrect. it should be changed to i, right? because if it's fixed to be one you will start only last.  Yes. Sorry. No problem. That's OK.  I’ve never tried to. OK. so, the number of new is the index divided by 2. Is that correct?  index is not given to us. index is not given to us. oh OK. cool. uh my logic is completely wrong. Yes. you are right. yeah. we have to divide by ourselves. if it's equal.  and if it is another function then.  The length is divided by two. and then should be math dot around or something like this.  uh yes. round down I think yes yeah. Math dot round. It should be floor. floor, because round may be round up.  Yes. OK. Is that correct? Array dot length. dot floor return double. we have to and.  It has never used. OK uh if it return double OK Umm sorry. double. index. you are right. yeah. you can put in front of me. yes. almost ready. is it good? digits, we send the index here. Then, what we are checksum. And is that OK or not? because of our array length, 12345618. so the length is 8 / 2 is 4. OK. that's fine. oh. that's fine or not? OK. that's fine. because we used a greater than and start by zero. should be 023. OK. cool. and the results, we have to return. we have to return the position that makes two side equal to each other.  oh OK. return a position. position is OK. some if true, we can we can return index. I think we have died from the game. so we don't, we don't need to calculate. we don't, we don't need. we need to divide by two. we first need to go to with the.  actually, I think it's OK. is OK. to reach the maximum is the number of array divide one by two. but we can stop before right I guess. and I’m not sure that in this programming language write like this or not. we can create something like boolean is equal to false and false. uh I think we can do something like this. if is equal to.  yes. and set is equal to true.  and we need to break from the loop function.  yes. exactly. what is the next one? for example what if like this 1 1 is equal. and then 3 3 is equal. but all 6 6  is also equal. but in our case, if do not calculate the one because it will say that OK. it is fine, then it will break. and we have to return the index, right? the index position. So, we should define the index. no. should define i before going to the loop. and we can return. no, sorry. my fault. we can also break. I have one more idea. I can run down. you can continue there. afterwards, check Umm.  I think we can return here because it's already found and we can return i. I but what. if but after the first iteration if you stop that station. you know what I mean? so, let's say that index is one and the i is one. and then, we get the first element and the last element, right? And then, some first will be one, some last will be one. Then, if you check if equal then break or return index to stop. It will not go further this. It could be.  So, we have to traverse and until the mid of the array, right? so then you're right. should be like this. No. in your case uh, we have to traverse until. no actually uh, calculate like this works only when size is the same size. But, what I mean is in our case uh if we have abcde  or the first we should to calculate a and b plus c plus d plus e. not. We go to the first to another group like a plus b and calculate c plus d plus e plus is the same one. Not go further. But, this loop does not have behavior like this. Do you get it? So, we have to first maybe maybe two loops.  I think I have an idea again.  uh let's try. Never mind. That's OK. So, we can sum first equal to sum last. Then is equal equal to true. OK.  Then let me try. you know this.  OK. and then it came here the next step.  else if sum fist is not equal sum last and is equal equal to true return i minus one.  If not equal, otherwise, continue. What about this one? One moment. Let me try a calculation in a couple minutes. Are you saying you have a problem? if we calculate like I mean some of the array. It means if we go from the left side and the right side at the same pace. Do you know what I mean? a b c d e. but what I understand is like if we start from the left side and calculate for the left side and every time, we calculate the left side calculate all right side or no we have the same.  We are the same also dropdown. this array length minus one is the last item. So, in the first iteration, we get one from the first. And then we get one from the last. And then we add the first one to here and the last one to here. and then compare it. if it is equal to the is equal to true and then in the next step. for example. for example, it is now 2, and then it will continue at true here and add another one from the last second to here. both of them sum first sum it again 3 is equal. so it equal to true again, it can continues until it's exact equal. and if it is not equal, and then the previous value of this equal. it’s also true so. that means the previous iteration was correct. and there is another step after that. So, then it should to return that index minus one. I think, maybe we can just try check them out.  OK. you we can try your solution first. yeah then if it doesn't work, then we can continue with yours.  ok. let’s try. here try let’s put the. we have the double index instead what we have trying, not it does it.  OK. I will try. oh what's happened. huh return. oh, you have to return everything and here you may be.  OK. now, can you run? Yes. I hope it will work. hey. what happened? OK. come on. It said index out of range. OK. now let's continue with yours. get index range. OK. let's see debug step by step. and we got index 4 for go inside.  index four? Ok. four. yes. and then they explore. oh because of we use length. oh should have because this thing is equal to 8 minus zero. why zero minus i. minus zero.  where is the debugger right now.  it's gone. I already. OK. let's see another one, here.  OK just go one step forward. should be one then.  should be equal, should be minus one because the array starts from zero you know what I mean?  yes. OK. yeah that's fine. OK. just really, so it's true. but should not be true, can you run again.  yes. what thing you have changed. ah yes. it should be enough i minus one. now it will. now I change it to 6. now it should return 2.  OK. let’s change to second one. it could be. should be zero, right? Your length should be. OK. cool. you're right. wow we finished! we couldn't finish the second one.  I think it is okay. we almost finished them.
