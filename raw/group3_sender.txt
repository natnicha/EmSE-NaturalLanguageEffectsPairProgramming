 OK let's start as we decided already. uh you are experienced so let's start first with you. you are the driver and i can read the navigator for this task at least please and then we can see what we can do. We should decide each by ourselves or it doesn't matter?  uh, they didn't say this is one will come as input or it will be just. Does a fixed static.  isn't written there? Complete metafunction converts. And. I think this will be input. Yeah. We can accept any input and output.  And what we will do here we will firstly change to the camel case and secondly we need to remove the underscore here.  OK. Uh, yeah, also there is that ship. Yeah. OK, nice. Let's try one method here. Didn't see.  It will return a string. If it is so in java. Yes. Again we are accepting one input. OK. Now, we should decide. Oh how to search inside the string that we can find if there is any dash or underscore? hmm oh you can search if there is split method because it in c#. We have a split method, I believe we have it in Java also. We can Google. We can use Google and get it. here We should have a string array. Uh, we should find which library we should import, because it will not come without importing. Let's see if it will. OK. Oh, it doesn't. Correct. Instead of us yes.  What should we import?  We can try like that. First. Let's say you can't uh, first element of the array. Hmm. We can.  Maybe we need to write inside of class or? Oh, please.  What did what do you have said? Sorry. When you went there. Yeah. And maybe we can write inside. Shouldn't be matter what makes. One shouldn't be matter.  Yeah, here. I believe we should import some files here. For example to use string here should be some important files that you can use string Please. This is yet to come. What do you say? Is it allowed to check from eclipse?  How many minutes we have?  Maybe we. OK.  Oh. Here it's it's OK, but there. Doesn't.  Wait.  I will Package. For example, we already installed all needed packages. Or we should we can add more packages.  OK. Hmm. So, uh, let's go step by step.  Maybe we can. Visual studio code java. Here. Install new according package for Java. You know. Who opened this project for us? They they used this product.  maybe we can start from create new project.  Maybe because of that I shared this one I need to. And and able to create a folder and I need to check let me check.  yes. I am sharing.  What was that?  why didn't you want to create a new project?  Uh, we can uh. Here we can create different project like a folder and on the folder file.  Structure should be like that, but project normally then I'm creating new project. Umm. Here I don't know how it's in Java but but in C# under solution you can create a lot of projects like project file extension for example. It can be console projects. Just console will show like this. This is console project for example. Displayed in the console.  Are you managing? Are you? Anything. You know that? The only one. Because I, uh, you couldn't. No, no, I don't like what I'm doing.  There up to my blog there is life share Workspace live share with bold letters. Here some there is add folder option. One one more quick, one more time. Yeah, yes, here in right folder and file you can new file and new folder. Do you mean Maybe, I mean. see it it's understand that this is Java code Java project. But in our case it didn't understand that this is Java OK. But there you see create our project we should create a project. Under general project we can add Java files.  yes and we can open Visual Studio a first page or it should be somewhere here. File, new file, new window, open file and folder. Oh, it's different than Visual Studio. It's different here.  Can you also send me that link with this quick start Java?   I see yours.  Do you see your phone? Anything row? Is this yours?  What is it? Oh,  OK, OK, this is OK. This is because of live share. That's why it's like that. Yes. OK, fine. OK. Actually time is up for this task.  We should set environment after that we can start to solve task. Why not? Why didn't do that you actually assaulted? Maybe you already know it. No, this is almost first time I'm using the Visual Studio. We are you programming with. Studio came. When? And then?  OK then start from beginning. Let's set the environment after that. Hmm.  Did you, uh, try to join again? Uh, you know, after your name is there. Yes, that is true. So you should see now.  Gulnar, I want to reload . Let me check. Um, because each time I need to give it access to you. But I couldn't see again you in the room. Yeah. Did you maybe? Uh, let me share.  Let me restart the video go to studio because. Or who created this? My blog part. To turn are you here?  Yeah, I will again send you. I just reward the Visual Studio good. While I was suspicious about maybe I didn't complete the installation of Java package. So, OK? Oh, Can you set this is project? Are you , work together with tALHE?. He is. We are again the same. I put the same purpose.  this collaboration station is no longer active. Yeah. OK. Open. Yes. He's. And you drive, right. Again the same problem. Oh. Even.  Can you try once again?  Is this same link?.  It didn't ask anything for me.  Uh.  Invite participant. Trying to see. Before, at least you were able to join. Now.  You see me? Yeah, now.  could you edit or no?  New problem. The public type program must be defined in its own file. Only files. You can add file here. New plan, OK. No.  OK. OK, great. Oh yeah, here it recognize this is java file . This is fine.   I refresh again because package was installed but I didn't reload the Visual Studio code.  Are you? OK. OK, OK. So now you can start to make task? What should we do? And Now we need main class in Java to test it. Name of the? Thanks. hmm.  what was named in java. Thanks. Sorry. Yes, now you can. Oh. 3. No. Yeah.  So I see as I remember.  Wait. What happened? . One and one. OK.  We don't. I don't understand. Actually it's installed. Debugger for Java is already installed. Uh, it doesn't even. Right. So I don't really understand.  I see a little bit different. Maybe I'm the host. There is a uninstall button disable. Switch to previous version. Let's use code. Press F5 to. On the code that we need.  Maybe we should import that file here. The name of debugger. What's the name of that package, I think or the one or?  The debugger for java extension is not available for web. Oh OK hey, this is not available for web.  You can do it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  What I need to do   Yes, there is a some bugs.  yes, there is. There is a lot of them. Yeah. Can you see? OK, perfect.  You see the output?  What do you see?  not applicable argument chart OK, it shouldn't be char. It should be string run it again.  It's own file?.  Maybe we need to import? In own file. Here we have two time public, with public static. Why do we have? Here in the sorting in the wrong part. No, this is here.  This one shouldn't be here. This one is a single and this is one more this one. OK. OK. And we. Why it shows this incorrect must be defined in known file.  I mean, I mean do you know what I mean? Here in 13 row 13, line 13 there is public static void and again public static void.  What it say? Problem is not this one but let s do it.  Solution. Wait. You also ready? Oh, you couldn't see what I'm writing?  Why it is so?  What you write.  Because of system scanner when we scan anything.  So we have two main. Where is it come from.  Where is the two main?   Can you put from?  You couldn't?  is there 10 problems?  Then this is the old. You can do again?. I close it because.  And what did you say?  OK. Yes, I did. What do you see? What you see there is. Two task, one tab on your Visual Studio code. Why?  What do you mean here? We can search for it. We have written following.  Our time is up, so we can go for other task.  Uh, is that because of this?  Yet still, we didn't. Yeah. Let's take this.  So do you want to write inside one file or with your intention? can you run this one? OK then great, I know what's the problem then OK, we don't need this part. Uh, putting it here? Remove this from here? Hmm. OK. I don't have this one. Removing this one. Inside the it should be. What it's like when I try to remove this part? What was happening when you wanted to write? Remove it? Can you run this one? OK, OK, OK, OK, I know what's the problem. OK, task one. OK. Ca you run again? What you see. At one.  Who do you see the errors? Or?  Is it problem part? What's the name of our class here? That's why we need to import task  one no?  Oh, can you debug it?  Oh, I mean you here, I don't know how to put breakpoints. What's happened?  need To click problems on programs or?.  debug part for evaluate session? Um, you started?? Did you put some breakpoint?in which line?.  in order to debug we have to put breakpoint there. OK, OK. OK. So. Function. Transistor. It is positive parameter normal and return is complicated persistent which is among row trying to much more complicated business and now until you reach the single digit. OK. I mean. Because. Hmm. OK. Uh, for this we have to open new file or we we can we can.  I already open the two more fire for other tasks then we can upload.  OK, we can. Second one, second one with it said.  What to put the? Persistence forest. What kind of? Yeah, it's says except one input, but in the first task. It didn't say that.  OK. First putting here also one main method to check. You see here it's double again. It puts this one here.  Yeah it was the problem?  Yeah, I'm getting it from here and putting. Class name is now class two. Class name  should be upper. Yeah. Let's.  Ah, OK, maybe that's why. Yeah. What did you did? No. Now it's updated.  OK, I'm sending number, let s saying this one. This. No, it is int not integer OK. Return. I'm just testing just, uh, can you click the run?  Do you see any any unresolved compilation problem in the main? Why there is no problem?  Oh why? Where you see problem?  Where is freedom static? Static. it was on my Visual Studio like stati.  In yours I see that it's correct but.  So strange. So strange.  So we had to use this live share one share or it's optional?  OK. I didn't like it. Everything looks good in your page. Your screen. Can you test it?  And do you mean would would? Do you wanna from me to test ?  It's possible to run this file? If Not possible. No need to continue. We have to set the environment.  Do you want one of from me to run this code?  I did several times.  What you see?  Five past two must be defined. OK, let's maybe it's because of upper and changing.  Now you can run it  It's OK, you see the input? Is there no problem? You should see Three, in the console You don't see.  OK, great. Now we can do that.   OK. OK. OK. OK. Now, we have to think about the solution. I found One solution, but I'm not sure it.  Oh. we can convert it to string then say our inputs 375 OK and. Get all the digits. And. Oh. Calculate them. Let's repeat it until the digit is 1. Uh, one digit  is there.  OK, but this is my solution we can try. OK. 3. Then. This number.  value okay. 3 value of. And while while Um. Great the number than 1. Then one yes.  Yeah, if it's one. Then it will be, yeah, we will return this one back. This one but uh, connecting to int. OK. Uh,string to int in java  clean.  integer parse it? Why you can't see mine? Of course.   value of this one yes. now. We will check. Uh, let's say this is 325. Hmm. Oh. Str number.  Then you're getting the length. Hmm. Is it in? And. Oh. And. OK. And. for. Yes. Umm. OK, OK. OK. OK. And yes, zero. Yes and 10 equal, yes. Str number. Uh, this one? I'm getting this from here. put  In this inside. Maybe i yes. Uh. Let us do it one. Yeah.  OK, after all of them, Str number again will be this one. Uh, no, not this one.  Yes. Uh. Of not str. Yeah, this one. Will be 10.  next. It should work like that. Let's say we accept 325 yes no string  325 because length more than one we entered here. Uh, we get blanks. No need to do this one. You can put it here.  Now we said some be OK 1,10th no, we are calculating it's 3. 3. This is 3,3,2,6, yes, 35, yes. Thank you. Then will be 30. Yes. Now our new number is Str number is 13. Yes. And he explained more than one. Yes, it's more than one.  Yeah. Can you test it with number?  Result to, set, theory. again  is something. What you see . What you see in your screen. Uh, no, no, no. Maybe there is bug, but. What I see? Uh. OK, return inside you can't be resolved. Mm-hmm. Return integer vwhere is return integer, return this one this. Oh, can't be resolved. It's not working. Maybe this is not working. This is not correct. Let's do this one.  integer this one, this one? Not not right. OK.  You do? What  integer ? You entered as input. OK, this one OK. It should return five. Who did you? It returned five.  What is  the problem.  type of expression must be an array type, but it is resolved str string. Where it should be array type.  is it different than mine?  Can you change what you see here?  OK, just click again. Run.  And what you see here is the same as yours. can you drop down? Is is this all are the same as I see in your screen  where should be array. Oh, integer parse int. OK. Uh, next time can give me. I.  we said that it's array or what happened, but we changed to it.  Hmm.  Then this multipation, month multipation. Then this one to one, it's one again. Again this is one. Yes. Second time I'm getting five here and in 1,2,5,5, yes. Str number is string again. This is number I'm converting into string and setting here.  I this is not. This is uh, to get the string given the index and getting the number. Yeah yes these one checking index this one.  Maybe this is not working like that in the Java nokay this work in this way in C#. Uh. Yeah. As. OK, OK. I understand. Maybe it's not working in the Java.  You mean the you cannot write the index number as  we can change that structure. But new char?  OK, char at Ah OK, maybe not like that. Char at In that. OK, I understand. Like this we should do like this. OK, can you check?  Uh OK OK oh, char at was. Why? But they also and this is converted.  do you see char to how we call it.  How you can convert it to OK. This will be changed OK. Uh. Character get that value? Something.  What? value. Can you try?  Why? Where?  29..  OK, what do you see?  It's the same.  And there is a lot of string number cannot be resolved a lot of time strings. String str number turn on the cannot be resolved where it's so. Oh yeah, we need to switch another task. Let's do.  for sure We need to. Let's switch to.  Actually, most of the logic of the program is done, but yeah, we need to switch. I think. Unfortunately. Let's do this. Actually we already overtime.  Because it's not about solving the task, it's about that how we are working together. So that's why,  it is about arrays.  we are going to beginning array.. Want to the beginning of integers or job is to take the delay and find in an index end where the sum of the integer to the left of them. OK, is equal to the sum of integers to the right of them. If. There is no index. That would make this equal to minus one. This one. OK, let's say this is this. Your function will return the index three because at the third position of the array, the sum of the the website of the index one does not and some of the right and index both. Equal. OK. Ah, OK.  did You got no. Alright, as input you had to find start from here and here you have to sum them in which point, If the will be the same if say, let's say here. These parts, sum of these parts are the same. Some of this part you can index of the four. OK. Uh yeah, let's say oh, your function will return the index one because at the first position of the array. Uh, uh. Oh, this is a bit complex task.  What is it?  you see it here?.  yes. Then two. Minus 49. Again one. Uh, there's a lot of uh. And slow down. Yeah, it's still me.  OK, it gives more more example. OK, that's fine. You are given the area OK at index zero, the left side. In a zero even OK the right side. And minus. They both are equal to Zero then add it. OK, this type, the container and the arrays are equal to zero in this problem. OK England 0 is place where the left side and right side are equal.  What does it mean? I didn't understand. I index, 0 is the place where the left. I. And right side   OK, 40,50,60. Minus 20 yes it means empty array equals to the zero. Hmm. And this part also equals to the zero. That means we have to return index 0. Hmm. Hmm. I do. this part did you understand?.  Yes, this is zero. Yes, calculate them that it will be zero.  Yes, OK. This is index zero, Right part of the index index zero is zero, yes. Hmm. Left part of the index 0. Yes, there is no element  What did you say?   There is no element.  Here it says If there is no element,then 0 it's. Yeah, OK, yes. That means we have to return return 0.  as a result we have to return exactly that index is right to left.  OK, OK, let's do it. But how do you?  Uh. So let find some solution. I usually write on the paper is easy to.  we can create some methods. But first we have to find some solution. How? How calculate them? OK, maybe we can do like that. Let's say we started from index 0. Uh, current from left side. To the right side to left side you have can calculate this one yes to check if it's equal to left side of the that selected index.   Let's we didn't find it. Then we can move one more and calculate from there to here to then calculate this part oh I understand. Hmm. But I'm sure  We will not finish on time.  it will return int.  Array. What should be our method name. Nice. OK. It accept int array. Let us say numbers. Ok. We need 1/4. Int equal to zero.  and We need one more, one more. Maybe. You know. Numbers should be Here. There. Yeah. Yeah, we are checking. Hmm. OK. I'm starting from right side of array, yes. Hmm. Until. Until end of the array? OK,  OK. And I have to sum them, yes, yes. Right side. You know. Right side. Plus. Number list. Again the same problem I can say like that or not.  Index of this one. I do not know java accept it or not. No.  over there and yes, we can use. Uh, it can you? Give us use if probably. Right. Yes. Umm. Oh. Hmm. Oh, until it will reach, uh, two I selected yes, uh, I'm calculating right. I'll clean this park. Yes. Uh, again, other parts. Left part. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Right, not right. Next time. Next side index. Left side left side. Here it should start from k from 0. Let's see this k from zero, but it will should be smaller than i. Hmm, yes, smaller than I. Uh, I am.  What's the K?  OK.  And end of the calculator. If. Right side equal to left side. Then return. Yes, in other case. In any other case. You have to return minus 1. OK. No, no. I didn't complete yet. You know. And. Oh. In Java method named lowercase.. Yeah. System out println. You know.  Can you run it?  then I will see. Expected after this tokej. Simple man to complete expression, unresolved completion, segmental error on the token.  I'm not gonna be anything that.  Do you know what it shows? T.? Calculate equal side of array and underline certified. Can you drop down? T. 10. H wait I will Do. what it says 5. 5 comes.  could you see? No, I don't see it.  comes three.  It should be three. Yeah yes, it's three. Let's this this one also. Uh, this one? OK. Um, one.  Yeah, it's it's it's working great. So our time is also up.
